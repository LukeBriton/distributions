Vector-Valued Distributions

and Fourier Multipliers

This manuscript was originally planned to be Chapter VI, that is, the first chapter of Volume II of the treatise whose first volume is [1]. In the meantime I have changed the concept of that volume and do not plan to include this material. For this reason, and since some of the results presented here have already been cited by several authors being in possession of preliminary versions, I have decided to make it publicly available by putting it on my home page.

## Preface

In the study of evolution equations by functional-analytical techniques one is led quite naturally to the study of pseudodifferential operators with operator-valued symbols. If one wants to avoid being restricted to a Hilbert space setting -- that would be much too narrow for nonlinear problems -- one has to be able to handle efficiently distributions with values in general Banach spaces. In particular, one has to be in possession of a good theory of convolutions for the case that both factors are Banach-space-valued distributions. For this reason, specializing the much more general results of L. Schwartz to a Banach space setting, we develop in the first section the theory of vector-valued distributions. Since there seems to be no other complete exposition of this theory easily available we try to be rather complete, thus going beyond the minimum we really need.

Vector-valued distributions are most useful in connection with techniques of harmonic analysis in a Banach space setting. In particular, we prove some Fourier multiplier theorems involving operator-valued symbols. These results, combined with dyadic decompositions in the Fourier image, are of fundamental importance. They are developed in Section 2. It is an important fact that, unlike the Banach space version of the Mikhlin multiplier theorem, our multiplier theorems do not require any restriction on the class of Banach spaces, like the UMD property, for example.

In the last section we first give a simple application of vector-valued distribution theory to linear evolution equations. Namely, we introduce the concept of distributional solutions and give sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness. The rest of that section is then essentially devoted to a detailed study of the Gauss-Weierstrass semigroup and related subjects. Its results are fundamental for an in-depth study of function spaces.

Vector-Valued Distributions

The theory of vector-valued distributions has been created and almost completely developed by L. Schwartz about forty years ago. His results are very general since he considered distributions with values in LCSs. For our purposes it suffices to consider distributions with values in Banach spaces only. This allows for some simplifications of the general theory, and we shall develop the relevant parts of that theory in this more restricted setting in the present section.

It will be crucial for our purposes to be in possession of a good theory of convolutions and 'point-wise multiplications' of vector-valued distributions. These are special cases of bilinear operations on vector-valued distributions. In order to handle such bilinear operations we prove in Subsection 1.5 a basic extension theorem that allows us to carry the desired operations from scalar distributions over to the vector-valued setting. To prove the extension theorem we need a considerable amount of preparation, namely rather deep results from the theory of LCSs as well as approximation and subtle continuity theorems for concrete spaces of distributions and related operations. These preparations occupy Subsections 1.1 to 1.4.

Having established the basic extension theorem in Subsection 1.5, it is not too difficult to define point-wise multiplications, tensor products, and convolutions for vector-valued distributions. This is done in Subsections 1.6-1.9. Finally, in the last subsection we introduce Laplace transforms for vector-valued distributions and prove the basic rules for dealing with them, as well as an important characterization theorem.

Although the proofs and techniques of this section are rather heavy, the final results are very simple to state and very satisfactory. Indeed, it can be said that, given the correct interpretation, all known rules for dealing with distributions carry over to the vector-valued setting.

In [1, Remark III.4.2.1] we have already commented on the possibility of defining a convolution for two vector-valued distributions and claimed that we will hardly have an occasion to use such a generality. In the meantime we became convinced, however, that the theory of distributions with values in Banach spaces is a very powerful tool with a high potential for nontrivial applications.

### Locally Convex Topologies

For the reader's convenience we collect in this subsection some more advanced topics from the theory of LCSs that we shall need below. Hereafter, we often use these facts without further mention.

#### The Uniform Boundedness Principle

An LCS is **barreled** if each absolutely convex, closed, and absorbing subset is a neighborhood of zero. Every Frechet space, hence every Banach space, is barreled ([16, III.6]). Every reflexive LCS is barreled. In fact, an LCS is reflexive iff it is barreled and bounded subsets are relatively weakly compact.

Let \(E\) and \(F\) be LCSs. A set \(\mathcal{A}\subset\mathcal{L}(E,F)\) is **equicontinuous** if for each neighborhood \(V\) of zero in \(F\) there exists a neighborhood \(U\) of zero in \(E\) such that \(A(U)\subset V\) for all \(A\in\mathcal{A}\). Equivalently, \(\mathcal{A}\) is equicontinuous iff to each continuous seminorm \(q\) on \(F\) there exists a continuous seminorm \(p\) on \(E\) such that

\[q(Ae)\leq p(e)\ ,\qquad e\in E\ ,\quad A\in\mathcal{A}\ .\]

The set \(\mathcal{A}\) is **uniformly bounded** if for each bounded subset \(B\) of \(E\) there exists a bounded set \(C\subset F\) such that \(A(B)\subset C\) for all \(A\in\mathcal{A}\). It is easily seen that each equicontinuous set is uniformly bounded. Finally, \(\mathcal{A}\) is **point-wise bounded** if \(\mathcal{A}(e):=\{\,Ae\ ;\ A\in\mathcal{A}\,\}\) is bounded in \(F\) for each \(e\in E\), that is, if \(\mathcal{A}\) is bounded in \(\mathcal{L}_{s}(E,F)\). Since \(\mathcal{L}(E,F)\hookrightarrow\mathcal{L}_{s}(E,F)\), every bounded subset of \(\mathcal{L}(E,F)\) is pointwise bounded. The uniform boundedness principle asserts that each pointwise bounded subset of \(\mathcal{L}(E,F)\) is equicontinuous, hence uniformly bounded, if \(E\) is barreled (e.g., [10, Proposition 11.1.1] or [15, Theorem III.4.2]). In particular, it follows that

\[\sup_{A\in\mathcal{A}}\|Ae\|<\infty\text{ for each }e\in E\quad\Longrightarrow \quad\sup_{A\in\mathcal{A}}\|A\|<\infty\ ,\] (1.1.1)

provided \(E\) and \(F\) are Banach spaces.

Suppose that \(E\) is barreled. Let \((A_{\alpha})\) be a net in \(\mathcal{L}(E,F)\) that is bounded in \(\mathcal{L}_{s}(E,F)\), and assume that \(Ae:=\lim A_{\alpha}e\) exists in \(F\) for each \(e\in E\). Then the Banach-Steinhaus theorem asserts that \(A\in\mathcal{L}(E,F)\) and that \(A_{\alpha}\to A\), uniformly on compact sets (e.g., [10, Theorem 11.1.3]). If \(E\) and \(F\) are Banach spaces and \((A_{j})\) is a sequence in \(\mathcal{L}(E,F)\) such that \((A_{j}e)\) converges in \(F\) for each \(e\in E\), it follows that

\[\|A\|\leq\liminf_{j\to\infty}\|A_{j}\|<\infty\] (1.1.2)

(e.g., [14, Corollary II.1.2]).

#### Hypocontinuity

Let \(G\) be a third LCS and let \(b:\,E\times F\to G\) be bilinear. Clearly, \(b\) is **separately continuous** if \(b(\cdot,f)\in\mathcal{L}(E,G)\) for each \(f\in F\) and \(b(e,\cdot)\in\mathcal{L}(F,G)\) for each \(e\in E\). Of course, every continuous bilinear map is separately continuous. A separately continuous bilinear map is continuous if \(E\) and \(F\) are Frechet spaces (e.g., [12, Theorem 2.1.7] or [16, Theorem 4.7.1]).

The map \(b\) is **hypocontinuous** if \(b(\cdot,f):\ E\to G\) is continuous, uniformly with respect to \(f\) in bounded subsets of \(F\), and \(b(e,\cdot):\ F\to G\) is continuous, uniformly

---

with respect to \(e\) in bounded subsets of \(E\). If \(b\) is hypocontinuous, it is separately continuous and \(b(A,B)\) is bounded in \(G\) if \(A\) is bounded in \(E\) and \(B\) is bounded in \(F\). Moreover, \(b\) is continuous on \(A\times F\) and on \(E\times B\), and uniformly continuous on \(A\times B\) (e.g., [10, Propositions 4.7.2 and 4.7.3] or [11, III.5.3]). Consequently, every hypocontinuous bilinear map is sequentially continuous.

Every separately continuous bilinear map is hypocontinuous if \(E\) and \(F\) are barreled (e.g., [10, Theorem 4.7.2] or [11, III.5.2]). Of course, a continuous bilinear map is hypocontinuous.

The following lemma will be useful for proving the hypocontinuity of certain bilinear maps.

**1.1.1 Lemma** _Suppose that \(F\) is barreled. Then the bilinear map_

\[{\cal L}(E,F)\times{\cal L}(F,G)\to{\cal L}(E,G)\ ,\quad(S,T)\mapsto TS\]

_is hypocontinuous._

**Proof** Let \(q\) be a continuous seminorm on \(G\) and let \(B\) be a bounded subset of \(E\). Let \({\cal T}\subset{\cal L}(F,G)\) be bounded. It follows from the uniform boundedness principle that there exists a continuous seminorm \(p\) on \(F\) such that

\[q(Tf)\leq p(f)\ ,\qquad f\in F\ ,\quad T\in{\cal T}\ .\]

Consequently,

\[\sup_{e\in B}q(TSe)\leq\sup_{e\in B}p(Se)\ ,\qquad S\in{\cal L}(E,F)\ ,\quad T \in{\cal T}\ ,\]

which shows that

\[(S\mapsto TS)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal L}(E,F),{\cal L}(E,G)\bigr{)}\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(T\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal L}(F,G)\).

Let \({\cal S}\subset{\cal L}(E,F)\) be bounded. Then \({\cal S}\) is uniformly bounded. Hence there exists a bounded subset \(C\) of \(F\) such that \(S(B)\subset C\) for \(S\in{\cal S}\). Consequently,

\[\sup_{e\in B}q(TSe)\leq\sup_{f\in C}q(Tf)\ ,\qquad T\in{\cal L}(F,G)\ ,\quad S \in{\cal S}\ ,\]

which shows that

\[(T\mapsto TS)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal L}(F,G),{\cal L}(E,G)\bigr{)}\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(S\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal L}(E,F)\).

**Montel Spaces** Recall that an LCS is a **Montel space** if it is barreled and bounded subsets are relatively compact. Since the unit-ball of a Banach space is relatively compact iff

---

it is finite-dimensional, there are no infinite-dimensional Banach-Montel spaces. Every Montel space is reflexive (e.g., [11, SS9]). The dual of a Montel space is a Montel space as well (e.g, [11, Proposition 9 in Section 3, SS9]).

#### Strict Inductive Limits

Let \(E\) be a vector space and let \(\{\,E_{\alpha}\,\,;\,\,\alpha\in\mathsf{A}\,\}\) be a family of subspaces such that:

1. Each \(E_{\alpha}\) is a Frechet space.
2. If \(E_{\alpha}\supset E_{\beta}\) then \(E_{\alpha}\) induces the original topology on \(E_{\beta}\).
3. There exists a cofinal increasing sequence \((E_{n})\) in \(\{\,E_{\alpha}\,\,;\,\alpha\in\mathsf{A}\,\}\), that is, \(E_{n}\subset E_{n+1}\) and to each \(E_{\alpha}\) there is an \(E_{n}\) with \(E_{n}\supset E_{\alpha}\).
4. \(\bigcup_{\alpha}E_{\alpha}=E\).

Then there exists a finest locally convex Hausdorff topology \(\tau\) on \(E\) such that \(E_{\alpha}\hookrightarrow E\) for each \(\alpha\in\mathsf{A}\), the (strict) **inductive limit topology** or **LF-topology** induced by \(\{\,E_{\alpha}\,\,;\,\,\alpha\in\mathsf{A}\,\}\). The LCS \((E,\tau)\) is denoted by

\[\lim_{\longrightarrow}E_{\alpha}=\lim_{\stackrel{{\longrightarrow }}{{\alpha}}}E_{\alpha}\]

and said to be an **LF-space**. Every LF-space is complete and barreled, and induces on each \(E_{\alpha}\) its original topology. A subset \(B\) of \(E\) is bounded iff \(B\subset E_{\alpha}\) for some \(\alpha\in\mathsf{A}\) and \(B\) is bounded in \(E_{\alpha}\). Let \(F\) be an LCS. Then a linear map \(T:\,E\to F\) is continuous iff \(T\,|\,E_{\alpha}\) is continuous from \(E_{\alpha}\) into \(F\) for each \(\alpha\in\mathsf{A}\). This is the case iff each \(T\,|\,E_{\alpha}\) is bounded. Thus an LF-space \(E\) is **bornological**, that is, every bounded linear map from \(E\) into an LCS is continuous. Clearly, every Frechet space, hence every Banach space, is an LF-space (e.g., [1, IV], [11, II.12], [12, II.6-II.8]).

It follows from (iii) that our inductive limits are countable. Thus, in principle, we could have restricted ourselves to the consideration of sequences \((E_{k})\) only, instead of admitting possibly uncountable families \(\{\,E_{\alpha}\,\,;\,\,\alpha\in\mathsf{A}\,\}\). However, the given formulation is well adapted to the concrete spaces we have in mind. In those cases, uncountable families of Frechet spaces occur naturally. Then we do not have to select a particular sequence and keep repeating that the topology is independent of that particular sequence.

#### Smooth Functions

Let \(X\) be a nonempty open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and let \(E\) be a Banach space. Recall from [1, Subsection III.4.1] that

\[\mathcal{E}(X,E):=\Big{(}C^{\infty}(X,E),\,\,\{\,p_{m,K}\,\,;\,\,m\in\mathbb{N },\,\,K\subset\subset X\,\}\Big{)}\]

is a Frechet space, where the seminorms \(p_{m,K}\) are defined by

\[p_{m,K}(u):=\max_{|\alpha|\leq m}\|\partial^{\alpha}u\|_{\infty,K}\ .\] (1.1.3)

---

#### Test Functions

Given \(K\subset\subset X\), let

\[\mathcal{D}_{K}(X,E):=\big{\{}\,u\in\mathcal{E}(X,E)\ ;\ \operatorname{supp}(u) \subset\overline{K}\,\big{\}}\ .\] (1.1.4)

Then \(\mathcal{D}_{K}(X,E)\) is a closed linear subspace of \(\mathcal{E}(X,E)\), and

\[\bigcup_{K\subset\subset X}\mathcal{D}_{K}(X,E)=\big{\{}\,u\in\mathcal{E}(X,E) \ ;\ \operatorname{supp}(u)\subset\subset X\,\big{\}}\ .\]

Let

\[X_{k}:=\big{\{}\,x\in X\ ;\ \operatorname{dist}(x,X^{c})>1/k\,\big{\}}\cap k \mathbb{B}^{n}\ ,\qquad k\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\] (1.1.5)

where \(\operatorname{dist}(x,\emptyset):=\infty\). Then

\[X_{k}\subset\subset X_{k+1}\ ,\qquad\bigcup_{k}X_{k}=X\ .\] (1.1.6)

Hence \(\big{(}\mathcal{D}_{X_{k}}(X,E)\big{)}\) is a cofinal increasing sequence in \(\big{\{}\,\mathcal{D}_{K}(X,E)\ ;\ K\subset\subset X\,\big{\}}\). Thus

\[\mathcal{D}(X,E):=\lim_{K\subset\subset X}\,\mathcal{D}_{K}(X,E)\ ,\]

the **space of \(E\)-valued test functions**, is an LF-space (cf. Subsection III.1.1 of [1]).

#### Rapidly Decreasing Smooth Functions

Also recall from [1, Subsection III.4.1] that the Schwartz space of smooth rapidly decreasing \(E\)-valued functions on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) is defined by

\[\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E):=\left(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E),\{\,q_{k,m} \ ;\ k,m\in\mathbb{N}\,\}\right)\ ,\]

where

\[q_{k,m}(u):=\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\atop|\alpha|\leq m}(1+|x|^{2})^{k}\,| \partial^{\alpha}u(x)|\ .\] (1.1.7)

#### Slowly Increasing Smooth Functions

Finally, we recall that \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) is the space of slowly increasing smooth functions on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\). This means that \(u\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) iff \(u\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and, given \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\), there exist \(m_{\alpha}\in\mathbb{N}\) and \(c_{\alpha}>0\) such that

\[|\partial^{\alpha}u(x)|\leq c_{\alpha}(1+|x|^{2})^{m_{\alpha}}\ ,\qquad x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}\ .\] (1.1.8)

Moreover, \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) is given the topology induced by the family of seminorms1

Footnote 1: For a proof of the fact that these seminorms are well-defined we refer to Proposition 1.6.1.

\[u\mapsto\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}u\|_{\infty}\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{S}( \mathbb{R}^{n})\ ,\quad\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\ ,\] (1.1.9)

so that it is an LCS.

---

#### Spaces of Vector-Valued Distributions

To simplify the writing we agree to put

\[\mathfrak{F}(X,E):=\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\qquad\text{if}\quad\mathfrak{F} \in\{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{O}_{M}\}\ .\] (1.1.10)

Then, as usual,

\[\mathfrak{F}(X):=\mathfrak{F}(X,\mathbb{K})\ ,\qquad\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D} ,\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{O}_{M}\}\ ,\]

if no confusion seems likely, and

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E):=\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(X),E\big{)}\] (1.1.11)

so that

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)=\mathfrak{F}(X)^{\prime}\]

for \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{O}_{M}\}\). (Recall that \(\mathcal{L}\) is always given the bounded convergence topology.)

If \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X,E)\) then, as a rule, we write \(u(\varphi)\) for the value of \(u\) at \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(X)\). However, if \(u\) is a scalar distribution, that is, \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X)\), then we continue to denote \(u(\varphi)\) by \(\langle u,\varphi\rangle\).

**1.1.2 Theorem**: _Let \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{O}_{M}\}\). Then \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\) and \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\) are complete Montel spaces, hence reflexive._

Proof Every LF-space is complete and bornological. The dual of a bornological LCS is complete (e.g., [12, IV.6.1]). Hence \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\) and \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\) are complete for \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S}\}\). The fact that \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\) is a Montel space for \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S}\}\) is well-known (e.g., [13, Examples 3, 4, and 6 in Section 3, SS9]). Thus \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\) is a Montel space in these cases as well. The assertion for \(\mathfrak{F}=\mathcal{O}_{M}\) follows from [14, II.4.4].

### Convolutions

In [1, Subsection III.4.2] we have already stated the definition of the convolution of a vector-valued distribution and a scalar test function, as well as some of its basic properties. In this subsection we present proofs for some of the less obvious properties. In addition, we extend the definition to include convolutions of a vector-valued and a scalar distribution.

#### Convolutions of Distributions and Test Functions

Let \(E:=(E,|\cdot|)\) be a Banach space. Recall from [1, Subsection III.4.2] that, given

\[(u,\varphi)\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\times\mathfrak{F}( \mathbb{R}^{n})\ ,\qquad\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}\}\ ,\]

---

the convolution, \(u*\varphi\), of \(u\) and \(\varphi\), is defined by

\[u*\varphi(x):=u(\tau_{x}\check{\varphi})\ ,\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ .\] (1.2.1)

As already noted, the usual scalar proof (e.g., [13, Theorem 4.1.1]) carries over to the present situation to show that \(u*\varphi\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\) and

\[\partial^{\alpha}(u*\varphi)=\partial^{\alpha}u*\varphi=u*\partial^{\alpha} \varphi\ ,\qquad\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\ .\] (1.2.2)

Moreover,

\[\mathrm{supp}(u*\varphi)\subset\mathrm{supp}(u)+\mathrm{supp}(\varphi)\] (1.2.3)

so that

\[u*\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\qquad\mathrm{if}\quad(u,\varphi) \in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\times\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ .\] (1.2.4)

It is obvious that convolution is bilinear. For the reader's convenience we prove now that it is hypocontinuous.

**1.2.1 Proposition**: _Convolution is a bilinear and hypocontinuous mapping_:

* \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\times\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\to \,\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\);
* \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\times\,\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\to \,\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\);
* \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\times\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\to \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\).

**Proof** To simplify the notation we put \(\mathcal{D}:=\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\) and \(\mathcal{E}:=\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\).

(i) Let \(K_{r}:=r\mathbb{B}^{n}\) for \(r>0\). Then \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\) if and only if \(u\in\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}_{K_{r}}\,,E)\) for each \(r>0\).

Let \(A\) be a bounded subset of \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\). Given \(r>0\), the uniform boundedness principle implies the existence of \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) such that

\[|u(\varphi)|\leq cp_{k,K_{r}}(\varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{D}_{K_{r}}\ , \quad u\in A\ .\]

Observe that

\[x\in K_{\rho}\ ,\ \ \varphi\in\mathcal{D}_{K_{r}}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\tau _{x}\check{\varphi}\in\mathcal{D}_{K_{r+\rho}}\] (1.2.5)

and

\[p_{k,K_{r+\rho}}(\tau_{x}\check{\varphi})=p_{k,x-K_{r}}(\tau_{x}\check{\varphi })=p_{k,K_{r}}(\varphi)\] (1.2.6)

for \(\rho>0\). Consequently,

\[p_{K_{\rho}}(u*\varphi)=\sup_{x\in K_{\rho}}|u(\tau_{x}\check{\varphi})|\leq cp _{k,K_{r+\rho}}(\tau_{x}\check{\varphi})=cp_{k,K_{r}}(\varphi)\] (1.2.7)

for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}_{K_{r}}\) and \(u\in A\). Now we obtain from (1.2.2) that

\[p_{j,K_{\rho}}(u*\varphi)\leq cp_{k+j,K_{r}}(\varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in \mathcal{D}_{K_{r}}\ ,\quad u\in A\ ,\quad j\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\quad\rho>0\ .\]

This shows that

\[(\varphi\mapsto u*\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}_{K_{r}}\,, \mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad u\in A\ ,\quad r>0\ .\] (1.2.8)

Hence \((\varphi\mapsto u*\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}( \mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\big{)}\), uniformly with respect to \(u\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\).

---

Now let \(B\) be a bounded subset of \(\mathcal{D}\). Then there exists \(r>0\) such that \(B\) is contained and bounded in \(\mathcal{D}_{K_{r}}\). It follows from (1.2.7) and (1.2.2) that

\[p_{j,K_{\rho}}(u*\varphi)=\max_{|\alpha|\leq j}\sup_{x\in K_{\rho}}|u*\partial^{ \alpha}\varphi(x)|\leq c\sup_{\psi\in C}|u(\psi)|\ ,\] (1.2.9)

where

\[C:=\big{\{}\,\tau_{x}(\partial^{\alpha}\varphi)^{\ \sim\ }\ ;\ x\in K_{\rho},\ | \alpha|\leq j,\ \varphi\in B\,\big{\}}\]

is a bounded subset of \(\mathcal{D}\), thanks to (1.2.5) and (1.2.6). Consequently,

\[(u\mapsto u*\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}, E),\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(\varphi\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{D}\). This proves the hypocontinuity of (i).

(ii) Let \(A\) be a bounded subset of \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)=\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{E},E)\). Then the uniform boundedness principle implies the existence of \(r>0\) and \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) such that

\[|u(\varphi)|\leq cp_{k,K_{r}}(\varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{E}\ ,\quad u \in A\ .\] (1.2.10)

Thus, given \(\rho>0\) and \(x\in K_{\rho}\),

\[|u(\tau_{x}\varphi)|\leq cp_{k,K_{r}}(\tau_{x}\varphi)\leq cp_{k,K_{r}+\rho}( \varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{E}\ ,\quad u\in A\ .\]

Hence, by (1.2.2), given \(\rho>0\),

\[p_{j,K_{\rho}}(u*\varphi)\leq p_{k+j,K_{r+\rho}}(\varphi)\ ,\qquad j\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\quad\varphi\in\mathcal{E}\ ,\quad u\in A\ ,\]

which shows that \((\varphi\mapsto u*\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{E},\mathcal{E}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\), uniformly with respect to \(u\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

If \(B\) is a bounded subset of \(\mathcal{E}\), estimate (1.2.9) is valid, where \(C\) is now a bounded subset of \(\mathcal{E}\). Hence \((u\mapsto u*\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}, E),\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\), uniformly with respect to \(\varphi\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{E}\). Thus (ii) is hypocontinuous as well.

(iii) Suppose that \(A\) is a bounded subset of \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). Then we infer from (1.2.10) that \(u(\varphi)=0\) for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\setminus K_{r})\) and \(u\in A\). Thus \(\operatorname{supp}(u)\subset K_{r}\) for \(u\in A\). Hence we deduce from (1.2.3) and (1.2.8) that

\[(\varphi\mapsto u*\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}_{K_{\rho}}, \mathcal{D}_{K_{r+\rho}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad u\in A\ ,\quad\rho>0\ .\]

Since \(\mathcal{D}_{K_{r+\rho}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{ R}^{n},E)\), we see that

\[(\varphi\mapsto u*\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}_{K_{\rho}}, \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad\qquad u\in A\ ,\quad\rho>0\ .\]

Consequently, \((\varphi\mapsto u*\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D},\mathcal{D}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\), uniformly for \(u\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

---

If \(B\) is a bounded subset of \({\cal D}\), then we deduce from (1.2.9) and (1.2.3) that

\[(u\mapsto u*\varphi)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E),{ \cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\bigr{)}\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(\varphi\in B\). Hence (iii) is also hypocontinuous.

**Translation-Invariant Operators**

It is easy to verify that

\[u(\varphi)=u*\breve{\varphi}(0)=\breve{u}*\varphi(0)\] (1.2.11)

and

by Proposition 1.2.1. The same arguments show that

\[\bigl{(}\varphi\mapsto u*(v*\varphi)\bigr{)}\!\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal D}({\mathbb{ R}}^{n}\,),{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\bigr{)}\ .\]

Thus (III.4.2.15) of [Ama95] and Theorem 1.2.2 guarantee the existence of a unique distribution \(u*v\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), the **convolution** of \(u\) and \(v\), such that

\[(u*v)*\varphi=u*(v*\varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\ .\]

It is clear that convolution is bilinear. The next proposition shows that it is hypocontinuous as well.

**1.2.3 Proposition**: _Convolution is a bilinear and hypocontinuous mapping_:

(i) \({\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\times{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^ {n}\,)\to{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\);

(ii) \({\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\times\,{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}} ^{n}\,)\to{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\);

(iii) \({\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\times\,{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}} ^{n}\,)\to\,{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\).

**Proof** (i) Let \(A\) and \(B\) be bounded subsets of \({\cal D}^{\prime}:={\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\) and \({\cal D}:={\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\), respectively. Since reflection is obviously a toplinear automorphism of \({\cal D}\) and of \({\cal D}^{\prime}\), it follows from Proposition 1.2.1 and the boundedness properties of hypocontinuous maps that

\[C:=\bigl{\{}\,(u*\varphi)^{\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$\mathchar 314$}}\ ;\ u\in A,\ \varphi\in B\,\bigr{\}}\]

is a bounded subset of \({\cal E}\). Hence, given \(v\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\),

\[\eqalign{\sup_{\varphi\in B}|v*u(\varphi)|=\sup_{\varphi\in B}|(v*u)*\varphi( 0)|&=\sup_{\varphi\in B}|v*(u*\varphi)(0)|\cr&=\sup_{\varphi\in B}\bigl{|}v \bigl{(}(u*\varphi)^{\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$\mathchar 314$}}\bigr{)} \bigr{|}=\sup_{\psi\in C}|v(\psi)|\ .\cr}\]

This shows that \((v\mapsto v*u)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E),{ \cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\bigr{)}\), uniformly with respect to \(u\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal D}^{\prime}\).

Let \((u_{\alpha})\) be a net in \({\cal D}^{\prime}\) converging to zero. Then \(u_{\alpha}*\varphi\to 0\) in \({\cal E}\), uniformly with respect to \(\varphi\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal D}\), thanks to Proposition 1.2.1(i). Consequently, Proposition 1.2.1(ii) guarantees that \(v*(u_{\alpha}*\varphi)\to 0\) in \({\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\), uniformly with respect to \(\varphi\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal D}\) and to \(v\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\). Hence \((v*u_{\alpha})(\varphi)=(v*u_{\alpha})*\varphi(0)\to 0\) in \(E\), uniformly with respect to \(\varphi\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal D}\) and to \(v\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\). This shows that \((u\mapsto v*u)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal D}^{\prime},{\cal D}^{\prime}({ \mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\bigr{)}\), uniformly with respect to \(v\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\). Hence (i) is hypocontinuous.

The hypocontinuity of (ii) and (iii) follows by modifying the above arguments in the obvious way.

**Elementary Properties of Convolutions**

**1.2.4 Remarks**: **(a) Let \(\delta\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\) be the Dirac distribution, that is,

\[\langle\delta,\varphi\rangle:=\varphi(0)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^ {n}\,)\ .\]

---

Then \(u*\delta=u\) for \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\).

**Proof** From (1.2.1) it is obvious that \(\delta*\varphi=\varphi\) for \(\varphi\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\). Hence

\[(u*\delta)*\varphi=u*(\delta*\varphi)=u*\varphi\ ,\qquad\varphi\in{\cal D}\ ,\]

by (1.2.13).

**(b)** Suppose that \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and \(v\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) and that \(u\) or \(v\) has compact support. Then

\[\partial^{\alpha+\beta}(u*v)=\partial^{\alpha}u*\partial^{\beta}v\ ,\qquad \alpha,\beta\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\ .\]

**Proof** By applying repeatedly (1.2.2) we see that

\[\partial^{\alpha+\beta}(u*v)*\varphi =(u*v)*\partial^{\alpha+\beta}\varphi=u*(v*\partial^{\alpha+ \beta}\varphi)\] \[=u*\partial^{\alpha}(\partial^{\beta}v*\varphi)=\partial^{\alpha} u*(\partial^{\beta}v*\varphi)=(\partial^{\alpha}u*\partial^{\beta}v)*\varphi\]

for \(\varphi\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\).

**(c)** Let \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and \(v\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) such that \(u\) or \(v\) has compact support. Then

\[\tau_{a}(u*v)=\tau_{a}u*v=u*\tau_{a}v\ ,\qquad a\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ ,\]

and

\[(u*v)^{\,\cdot}=\check{u}*\check{v}\ .\]

**Proof** This follows easily from (1.2.13) and (1.2.12), or (III.4.2.15) of [1], respectively.

**(d)** If \(\{\,\varphi_{\varepsilon}\ ;\ \varepsilon>0\,\}\) is a mollifier then \(\varphi_{\varepsilon}\to\delta\) in \({\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) as \(\varepsilon\to 0\). Consequently, \(\varphi_{\varepsilon}*u\to u\) in \({\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) as \(\varepsilon\to 0\) for \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\).

**Proof** Given \(\psi\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\),

\[\langle\varphi_{\varepsilon}-\delta,\psi\rangle=\int_{{\mathbb{R}}^{n}} \varphi_{\varepsilon}(x)\psi(x)\,dx-\psi(0)=\int_{{\mathbb{R}}^{n}}\varphi(y) \bigl{(}\psi(\varepsilon y)-\psi(0)\bigr{)}\,dy\ .\]

Hence, by the mean-value theorem,

\[|\langle\varphi_{\varepsilon}-\delta,\psi\rangle|\leq\sup_{|y|\leq 1}|\psi( \varepsilon y)-\psi(0)|\leq\varepsilon\sup_{|y|\leq 1}|\partial\psi(y)| \leq\varepsilon p_{1,{\mathbb{R}}^{n}}\,(\psi)\]

for \(0<\varepsilon\leq 1\). This shows that \(\langle\varphi_{\varepsilon}-\delta,\psi\rangle\to 0\) as \(\varepsilon\to 0\), uniformly with respect to \(\psi\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\), that is, \(\varphi_{\varepsilon}\to\delta\) in \({\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) as \(\varepsilon\to 0\). The second part of the assertion now follows from Proposition 1.2.3 and (a).

**Translation Groups on \({\cal S}\) and \({\cal S}^{\prime}\)**

Next we turn to the case of temperate distributions. For this we need some preparation.

---

**1.2.5 Lemma**: _The translation group acts strongly continuously on \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\)._

**Proof** Given \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(k,m\in\mathbb{N}\), we find

\[q_{k,m}(\tau_{x}\varphi)=\sup_{|x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\atop|x|\leq m}(1+|x+y|^{2})^ {k}|\partial^{\alpha}\varphi(y)|\leq 2^{k}(1+|x|^{2})^{k}q_{k,m}(\varphi)\] (1.2.14)

for \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\), thanks to the trivial inequality \(1+|x+y|^{2}\leq 2(1+|x|^{2})(1+|y|^{2})\). Hence \(\tau_{x}\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\). Thus, by the mean-value theorem,

\[q_{k,m}(\tau_{x}\varphi-\varphi)=q_{k,m}\Big{(}\int_{0}^{1}\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j} \tau_{tx}\partial_{j}\varphi\,dt\Big{)}\leq 2^{k}(1+|x|^{2})^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{n}|x_{j }|\,q_{k,m}(\partial_{j}\varphi)\ .\]

Consequently, \(\tau_{x}\varphi\to\varphi\) in \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) as \(x\to 0\). Since \(x\mapsto\tau_{x}\) is bounded on bounded sets, as follows from (1.2.14), we see that \((x\mapsto\tau_{x})\in C\big{(}\mathbb{R}^{n},\mathcal{L}_{s}(\mathcal{S}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E))\big{)}\).

We deduce from the Banach-Steinhaus theorem and the fact that \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) is a Montel space that

\[(x\mapsto\tau_{x})\in C\big{(}\mathbb{R}^{n},\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R }^{n}))\big{)}\ .\] (1.2.15)

Now \((\tau_{x}u)(\varphi)=u(\tau_{-x}\varphi)\) for \(u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), and \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\), and (1.2.15) imply that the translation group is also strongly continuous on \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

**Convolutions of Temperate Distributions**

It is clear that \((\varphi\mapsto\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E) \big{)}\). Thus, given \(u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), we can again define the **convolution**, \(u\ast\varphi\), by (1.2.1), since the right-hand side defines a continuous \(E\)-valued function of \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) by Lemma 1.2.5.

In order to prove continuity properties of this convolution map we need the following technical result.

**1.2.6 Lemma**: \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) _is a complete LCS._

**Proof** Let \((a_{\beta})\) be a Cauchy net in \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). From \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) it follows that \((a_{\beta})\) is a Cauchy net in \(\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). Since the latter space is complete, there exists \(a\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) such that \(a_{\beta}\to a\) in \(\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). Given \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\), \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), and \(\varepsilon>0\), there exists \(\beta_{0}\) such that

\[\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}a_{\beta}-\varphi\partial^{\alpha}a_{\gamma}\|_{ \infty}<\varepsilon\ ,\qquad\beta,\gamma\geq\beta_{0}\ .\]

Thus, since \(a_{\gamma}\to a\) in \(\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\),

\[\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}a_{\beta}-\varphi\partial^{\alpha}a\|_{\infty}\leq \varepsilon\ ,\qquad\ \ \beta\geq\beta_{0}\ .\]

Similarly,

\[\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}a_{\gamma}\|_{\infty}\leq\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}a _{\beta_{0}}\|_{\infty}+\varepsilon\ ,\qquad\gamma\geq\beta_{0}\ ,\]

implies \(\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}a\|_{\infty}<\infty\). Hence \(a\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(a_{\beta}\to a\) in \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

---

**1.2.7 Proposition**: _Convolution is a bilinear and_

* _continuous map_:_ \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\times\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\to\mathcal{S}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E)\);
* _hypocontinuous map_:_ \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\times\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\to \mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

**Proof** (i) Given \(u\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), it follows from \(\partial^{\alpha}u\in BUC(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) for \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\) and from [1, (III.4.2.10), (III.4.2.19)] that \(u\ast v\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) for \(v\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\subset L_{1}\). Note that

\[|x|^{2\ell}\leq(|x-y|+|y|)^{2\ell}=\sum_{j=0}^{2\ell}\tbinom{2\ell}{j}\,|x-y|^ {j}\,|y|^{2\ell-j}\]

implies

\[|x|^{2\ell}\,|u\ast v(x)| \leq\sum_{j=0}^{2\ell}\tbinom{2\ell}{j}\,\int|x-y|^{j}\,|u(x-y)| \,|y|^{2\ell-j}\,(1+|y|^{2})^{n}\,|v(y)|\,\frac{dy}{(1+|y|^{2})^{n}}\] \[\leq c_{\ell}q_{\ell,0}(u)q_{\ell+n,0}(v)\]

for \(u,v\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\). This proves (i).

(ii) If \(u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) then \(u\ast\varphi\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) by Proposition 1.2.1. Let \(U\) be a bounded subset of \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). Then there exist \(k,m\in\mathbb{N}\) with

\[|u(\varphi)|\leq cq_{k,m}(\varphi)\ ,\qquad u\in U\ ,\quad\varphi\in\mathcal{S} (\mathbb{R}^{n})\ .\]

Thus, for \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\), we deduce from (1.2.14) that

\[|\partial^{\alpha}(u\ast\varphi)(x)| =|(u\ast\partial^{\alpha}\varphi)(x)|=\big{|}u\big{(}\tau_{x}( \partial^{\alpha}\varphi)^{\,\cdot}\big{)}\,\big{|}\] \[\leq cq_{k,m}\big{(}\tau_{x}(\partial^{\alpha}\varphi)^{\,\cdot} \big{)}\leq c(1+|x|^{2})^{k}q_{k,m+|\alpha|}(\varphi)\]

for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and \(u\in U\). Consequently, given a bounded subset \(B\) of \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\),

\[\sup_{\varphi\in B}\|\psi\partial^{\alpha}(u\ast\varphi)\|_{\infty}\leq c_{k, m}\sup_{\varphi\in B}q_{k,0}(\psi)q_{k,m+|\alpha|}(\varphi)\]

for \(u\in U\) and \(\varphi\in B\cap\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\). This shows that, for \(u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), the linear map

\[\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\to\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\quad \varphi\mapsto u\ast\varphi\ ,\]

is continuous with respect to the topology induced on \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) by \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\), uniformly with respect to \(u\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). Since \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) is dense in \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) is complete, it follows that

\[(\varphi\mapsto u\ast\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n} ),\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(u\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

---

Now let \(B\) and \(C\) be bounded subsets of \({\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) and observe that, given \(\alpha\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\), the image of the map

\[{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times B\times C\to{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\ ,\quad(x,\psi, \varphi)\mapsto\psi(x)\tau_{x}(\partial^{\alpha}\varphi)\

---

**(d)**: The evaluation map \({\cal L}(E_{1},E_{0})\times E_{1}\to E_{0},\ (A,x)\mapsto Ax\).
**(e)**: Compositions \({\cal L}(E_{1},E_{2})\times{\cal L}(E_{0},E_{1})\to{\cal L}(E_{0},E_{2}),\ (S,T) \mapsto ST\).
**(f)**: Convolution in each one of the cases (III.4.2.18)-(III.4.2.22) of [1].
**(g)**: If \(b\in{\cal L}(E_{1},E_{2};E_{0})\) and \(b\neq 0\) then

\[E_{1}\times E_{2}\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(x_{1},x_{2})\mapsto\frac{1}{\|b\|}b(x_{1},x_{2})\]

is a multiplication. This shows that it is no restriction assuming that the norm of a multiplication is bounded by \(1\).

**Leibniz' Rule**

We also recall that, given any nonempty set \(S\), point-wise multiplication

\[E_{1}^{S}\times E_{2}^{S}\to E_{0}^{S}\ ,\quad(a_{1},a_{2})\mapsto a_{1}\bullet a _{2}\]

induced by (1.3.1) is defined by

\[a_{1}\bullet a_{2}(s):=a_{1}(s)\bullet a_{2}(s)\ ,\qquad s\in S\ .\]

**1.3.2 Lemma**: _Let \(p\in{\mathbb{K}}[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]\) be a polynomial of degree at most \(k\) in \(n\) indeterminates and let \(X\subset{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) be a nonempty open subset of \(\ {\mathbb{R}}^{n}\). Then, putting_

\[p^{(\beta)}:=\partial^{\beta}p\ ,\qquad\beta\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\ ,\]

_the_ **generalized Leibniz rule**

\[p(\partial)(a_{1}\bullet a_{2})=\sum_{\beta}\frac{1}{\beta!}(\partial^{\beta} a_{1})\bullet p^{(\beta)}(\partial)a_{2}\ ,\]

_holds for \(a_{j}\in C^{k}(X,E_{j})\), \(j=1,2\)._

**Proof** From the obvious 'product rule'

\[\partial_{j}(a_{1}\bullet a_{2})=\partial_{j}a_{1}\bullet a_{2}+a_{1}\bullet \partial_{j}a_{2}\ ,\qquad 1\leq j\leq n\ ,\] (1.3.2)

we deduce by induction that

\[p(\partial)(a_{1}\bullet a_{2})=\sum_{\beta}\partial^{\beta}a_{1}\bullet q_{ \beta}(\partial)a_{2}\ ,\qquad a_{j}\in C^{k}(X,E_{j})\ ,\quad j=1,2\ ,\] (1.3.3)

where \(q_{\beta}\in{\mathbb{K}}[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]\) and \(q_{\beta}=0\) for \(|\beta|>k\). Given \(y_{j}\in E_{j}\) and \(\xi,\eta\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\), we put \(a_{1}:=e^{(\xi,\cdot)}y_{1}\) and \(a_{2}:=e^{(\eta,\cdot)}y_{2}\). Since

\[e^{-\langle\zeta,\cdot\rangle}q(\partial)e^{\langle\zeta,\cdot\rangle}=q(\zeta )\ ,\qquad\zeta\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ ,\quad q\in{\mathbb{K}}[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]\ ,\] (1.3.4)

---

it follows from (1.3.3) that

\[p(\xi+\eta)y_{1}\bullet y_{2}=\sum_{\beta}\xi^{\beta}q_{\beta}(\eta)y_{1}\bullet y_ {2}\ .\]

Since this is true for every choice of \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\),

\[p(\xi+\eta)=\sum_{\beta}\xi^{\beta}q_{\beta}(\eta)\ ,\qquad\xi,\eta\in{\mathbb{R}}^ {n}\ .\]

By differentiating this identity with respect to \(\xi\) and putting \(\xi=0\) it follows that \(\partial^{\beta}p(\eta)=\beta!\,q_{\beta}(\eta)\). This proves the assertion.

Letting \(p(\xi):=\xi^{\alpha}\) in Lemma 1.3.2, we obtain the standard **Leibniz rule**:

\[\partial^{\alpha}(a_{1}\bullet a_{2})=\sum_{\beta\leq\alpha}{{}^{\alpha}_{ \beta}\choose{\beta}}\partial^{\beta}a_{1}\bullet\partial^{\alpha-\beta}a_{2} \ ,\qquad a_{j}\in C^{|\alpha|}(X,E_{j})\ ,\quad j=1,2\ .\] (1.3.5)

**Approximation by Test Functions**

After these preparations we can prove a useful approximation theorem for vector-valued distributions. For this we recall convention (1.1.10).

**1.3.3 Proposition**: _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S}\}\) and \(u\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E)\). Then there exists a sequence \((u_{j})\) in \({\cal D}(X,E)\) such that \(u_{j}\to u\) in \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E)\)._

**Proof** First suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E}\}\). Denote by \((X_{k})\) a sequence of nonempty relatively compact open subsets of \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) such that \(\overline{X}_{k}\subset X_{k+1}\) and \(\bigcup X_{k}=X\). For each \(k\in{\mathbb{N}}\) fix \(\chi_{k}\in{\cal D}(X)\) with \(\chi_{k}\,|\,X_{k}=1\). Then \(\chi_{k}u\in{\cal E}^{\prime}(X,E)\subset{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\). Denote by \(\{\,\psi_{\varepsilon}\ ;\ \varepsilon>0\,\}\) a mollifier such that \(\psi_{1}\) is even and put

\[u_{k}:=(\chi_{k}u)*\psi_{1/k}\ ,\qquad k\in\hat{{\mathbb{N}}}\ .\]

Then \(u_{k}\in{\cal D}(X,E)\) by Proposition 1.2.1. Given \(\varphi\in{\cal D}(X)\),

\[u_{k}(\varphi) = \bigl{(}(\chi_{k}u)*\psi_{1/k}\bigr{)}*\check{\varphi}(0)=(\chi_{ k}u)*(\psi_{1/k}*\check{\varphi})(0)\] \[= \chi_{k}u*(\check{\psi}_{1/k}*\varphi){{}^{\cdot}}(0)=u\bigl{(} \chi_{k}(\psi_{1/k}*\varphi)\bigr{)}\ ,\]

where we used (1.2.11), (1.2.12), and the evenness of \(\psi_{1/k}\). Since \(\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(\varphi)\subset X_{j}\) for some \(j\in{\mathbb{N}}\), it follows from [Ama95, (III.4.2.10) and (III.4.2.25)] that \(\psi_{1/k}*\varphi\to\varphi\) in \({\cal D}(X)\). Also \(\chi_{k}\to{\bf 1}\) in \({\cal E}(X)\). Consequently,

\[\chi_{k}(\psi_{1/k}*\varphi)\to\varphi\quad\hbox{in }{\cal D}(X)\qquad\hbox{if }\varphi\in{\cal D}(X)\ ,\] (1.3.6)

so that \(u_{k}(\varphi)\to u(\varphi)\) in \(E\). This means that

\[u_{k}\to u\quad\hbox{in }{\cal L}_{s}\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X),E\bigr{)}\ .\] (1.3.7)

---

Next we choose \(\varphi\in{\cal E}(X)\). Then the estimate

\[\eqalign{|\partial^{\alpha}(\psi_{\varepsilon}*\varphi)(x)-\partial^{\alpha} \varphi(x)|&=|\psi_{\varepsilon}*\partial^{\alpha}\varphi(x)-\partial^{\alpha} \varphi(x)|\cr&=\Big{|}\int\psi_{\varepsilon}(y)\big{[}\partial^{\alpha}\varphi (x-y)-\partial^{\alpha}\varphi(x)\big{]}\;dy\Big{|}\cr&=\Big{|}\int\psi(y)\big{[} \partial^{\alpha}\varphi(x-\varepsilon y)-\partial^{\alpha}\varphi(x)\big{]} \;dy\Big{|}\cr&\leq\sup_{|y|<1}|\partial^{\alpha}\varphi(x-\varepsilon y)- \partial^{\alpha}\varphi(x)|\cr}\]

for \(x\in X\) and \(0<\varepsilon<{\rm dist}(x,\partial X)\) shows that \(\psi_{1/k}*\varphi\to\varphi\) in \({\cal E}(X)\). Thus

\[\chi_{k}(\psi_{1/k}*\varphi)\to\varphi\quad{\rm in}\ {\cal E}(X)\qquad{\rm if} \ \varphi\in{\cal E}(X)\ ,\]

so that \(u_{k}(\varphi)\to u(\varphi)\) in \(E\) for \(u\in{\cal E}^{\prime}(X,E)\). Consequently,

\[u_{k}\to u\quad{\rm in}\ {\cal L}_{s}\big{(}{\cal E}(X),E\big{)}\qquad{\rm if} \ u\in{\cal E}^{\prime}(X,E)\ .\]

Now suppose that \(\varphi\in{\cal S}({\tenmsb R}^{n})\). Choose any sequence \((\chi_{k})\) in \({\cal D}({\tenmsb R}^{n})\) satisfying \(\chi_{k}\,|\,(k{\tenmsb R}^{n})=1\) and \({\rm supp}\,\chi_{k}\subset(k+1){\tenmsb R}^{n}\) such that

\[\sup_{k}\|\partial^{\alpha}\chi_{k}\|_{\infty}<\infty\ ,\qquad\alpha\in{ \tenmsb N}^{n}\ .\]

For example, put

\[\chi_{k}:=\psi_{\varepsilon}*\chi_{(k+1/2){\tenmsb R}^{n}}\ ,\qquad k\in{ \tenmsb N}\ ,\]

for a fixed \(\varepsilon\in(0,1/4)\). Then, using Leibniz' rule and (1.3.8), it is easily seen that

\[\chi_{k}(\psi_{1/k}*\varphi)\to\varphi\quad{\rm in}\ {\cal S}({\tenmsb R}^{n})\ .\]

Consequently, \(u_{k}(\varphi)\to u(\varphi)\) in \(E\) if \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\tenmsb R}^{n},E)\), which means that

\[u_{k}\to u\quad{\rm in}\ {\cal L}_{s}\big{(}{\cal S}({\tenmsb R}^{n}),E\big{)} \qquad{\rm if}\ u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\tenmsb R}^{n},E)\ .\]

Altogether, (1.3.7), (1.3.10), and (1.3.13) show that

\[u_{k}\to u\quad{\rm in}\ {\cal L}_{s}\big{(}\hbox{\goth F}(X),E\big{)} \qquad{\rm if}\ u\in\hbox{\goth F}^{\prime}(X,E)\]

for \(\hbox{\goth F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S}\}\). Now, by the Banach-Steinhaus theorem, \(u_{k}(\varphi)\to u(\varphi)\) in \(E\), uniformly for \(\varphi\) in compact subsets of \(\hbox{\goth F}(X)\). Since \(\hbox{\goth F}(X)\) is a Montel space it follows that \(u_{k}\to u\) in \({\cal L}\big{(}\hbox{\goth F}(X),E\big{)}=\hbox{\goth F}^{\prime}(X,E)\). This proves the assertion.

**1.3.4 Remark** The arguments leading to (1.3.9) and (1.3.12) remain valid if \(\hbox{\goth F}(X)\) is replaced by \(\hbox{\goth F}(X,E)\). This proves that

\[{\cal D}(X,E)\buildrel d\over{\hookrightarrow}{\cal E}(X,E)\quad{\rm and} \quad{\cal D}({\tenmsb R}^{n},E)\buildrel d\over{\hookrightarrow}{\cal S}({ \tenmsb R}^{n},E)\ ,\]

with sequential density, since the continuity of these injections is clear. This has already been stated in [Ama95, (III.4.1.2) and (III.4.1.5)], respectively.

---

Our next proposition shows that \({\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) is dense in \({\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) as well.

**1.3.5 Proposition**: \({\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}{ \cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\)_._

**Proof** Suppose that \(K\subset\subset{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\). Then, given \(\varphi\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) and \(\alpha\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\),

\[\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}u\|_{\infty}\leq\|\varphi\|_{\infty}\,\|\partial^{ \alpha}u\|_{\infty}\leq\|\varphi\|_{\infty}\,p_{|\alpha|,K}(u)\ ,\qquad u\in{ \cal D}_{K}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ .\]

This shows that \({\cal D}_{K}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\). Hence \({\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\).

Now fix \(u\in{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), as well as \(\varphi\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) and \(\alpha\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\). There exist \(m\in{\mathbb{N}}\) and \(c_{\alpha}>0\) such that

\[|\partial^{\beta}u(x)|\leq c_{\alpha}(1+|x|^{2})^{m}\ ,\qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}^ {n}\ ,\quad\beta\leq\alpha\ .\] (1.3.14)

Let \((\chi_{k})\) be a sequence as in (1.3.11). Then, by Leibniz' rule,

\[\partial^{\alpha}(\chi_{k}u)-\partial^{\alpha}u=\sum_{\beta<\alpha}{\alpha \choose\beta}\partial^{\alpha-\beta}\chi_{k}\partial^{\beta}u+(\chi_{k}-1) \partial^{\alpha}u\ .\]

Hence we infer from (1.3.11) and (1.3.14) that

\[\big{\|}\varphi\big{(}\partial^{\alpha}(\chi_{k}u)-\partial^{\alpha}u\big{)} \big{\|}_{\infty}\leq cq_{m+1,0}(\varphi)(1+k^{2})^{-1}\ ,\qquad k\in{ \mathbb{N}}\ .\]

Since \(\chi_{k}u\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), it follows that \({\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) is dense in \({\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\).

The preceding approximation results can be used to prove a number of useful density results. For this we make use of the following elementary facts that will also often be used without further mention:

**Density by Iteration**

Let \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) be topological spaces. It is obvious that

\[A\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}B\stackrel{{ d}}{{ \hookrightarrow}}C\quad\Longrightarrow\quad A\stackrel{{ d}}{{ \hookrightarrow}}C\] (1.3.15)

and

\[A\stackrel{{ d}}{{\subset}}C\ ,\quad A\subset B\subset C\quad \Longrightarrow\quad B\stackrel{{ d}}{{\subset}}C\ .\] (1.3.16)

Implication (1.3.16) is also true if \(d\) stands for 'sequentially dense'.

**Approximation by Tensor Products**

We recall from [1, Subsection V.2.4] that, given \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S},{\cal O}_{M}\}\), the tensor product \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E\) is defined by putting first

\[\varphi\otimes e(x):=\varphi(x)e\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X)\ ,\quad e\in E \ ,\quad x\in X\ ,\] (1.3.17)

---

and then

\[\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E:=\operatorname{span}\bigl{\{}\,\varphi\otimes e\ ;\ \varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X),\ e\in E\,\bigr{\}}\ ,\] (1.3.18)

where the linear hull is taken in \(E^{X}\). Analogously, we define the tensor product \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\otimes E\) by

\[(u\otimes e)(\varphi):=u(\varphi)e\ ,\qquad u\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\ ,\quad e\in E\ ,\quad\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X)\ ,\] (1.3.19)

and

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\otimes E:=\operatorname{span}\bigl{\{}\,u\otimes e\ ;\ u\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X),\ e\in E\,\bigr{\}}\ ,\] (1.3.20)

now the span being taken in \(E^{\mathfrak{F}(X)}\). It is obvious that \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E\subset\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) and \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\otimes E\subset\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E)\). In the following approximation theorem these tensor products are given the corresponding subspace topologies.

**1.3.6 Theorem**: \(\!\!

---

(ix) Given \(K=\overline{K}\subset\subset L=\overline{L}\subset\subset X\), choose \(\varphi\in{\cal D}(X)\) with \(\varphi\,|\,L=1\). Then \(\varphi u\in C^{k}(X,E)\) for \(u\in C^{k}(X,E)\), and \(\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(\varphi u)\subset\subset X\) with \(\varphi u\,|\,L=u\). By mollifying \(\varphi u\) we find \(v\in{\cal D}(X,E)\) satisfying \(v\,|\,K=u\). This gives \({\cal D}(X,E)\buildrel d\over{\hookrightarrow}C^{k}(X,E)\). Now the assertion is obvious, as is (x).

**Approximation by Polynomials**

Finally, we use this approximation theorem to prove the separability of the spaces under consideration, provided \(E\) is separable. For this we need a preparatory lemma that will be useful in Subsection 1.8 as well.

1.3.7 Lemma_Every element of \({\cal D}(X,E)\) is the limit in \({\cal E}(X,E)\) of a sequence of \((\)restrictions of\()\) polynomials \((\)in \(n\) indeterminates and with coefficients in \(E)\)._

**Proof** Define \(w\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) by

\[w(x):=(4\pi)^{-n/2}e^{-|x|^{2}/4}\ ,\qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ .\]

Then \(w\) is analytic and everywhere positive. Since \(w(x)=\prod_{j=1}^{n}w(x_{j})\), it follows from Fubini's theorem that \(\|w\|_{1}=\|w\|_{L_{1}({\mathbb{R}})}^{n}\). But, again by Fubini's theorem,

\[\eqalign{\Bigl{(}\int_{{\mathbb{R}}}e^{-x^{2}/4}\,dx\Bigr{)}^{2}&=\int_{{ \mathbb{R}}^{2}}e^{-(x^{2}+y^{2})/4}\,d(x,y)\cr&=2\pi\int_{0}^{\infty}re^{-r^{ 2}/4}\,dr=-4\pi e^{-r^{2}/4}\bigl{|}_{0}^{\infty}=4\pi\ .\cr}\]

Hence \(\|w\|_{1}=1\), and, putting

\[w_{t}(x):=t^{-n/2}w\bigl{(}x/\sqrt{t}\bigr{)}=(4\pi t)^{-n/2}e^{-|x|^{2}/(4t) }\ ,\qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ ,\quad t>0\ ,\]

it follows that \(\{\,w_{t}\ ;\ t>0\,\}\) is an approximate identity. Thus, given \(\varphi\in{\cal D}(X,E)\), we infer from [Ama95, (III.4.2.10) and (III.4.2.25)] that \(w_{1/k}*\varphi\to\varphi\) in \({\cal E}(X,E)\).

Let \(k\in\hbox{\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$\bullet$}\kern-12.0pt\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$ \bullet$}\kern-12.0pt\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$\bullet$}\kern-12.0pt\raise 1.5pt \hbox{$\bullet$}\kern-12.0pt\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$\bullet$}\kern-12.0pt \raise 1.5pt\hbox{$\bullet$}\kern-12.

---

**Proof** It is an obvious consequence of Theorem 1.3.6(i) that it suffices to prove that \({\cal D}(X)\) is separable. Thus let \({\cal P}\) be the set of all polynomials in \(n\) indeterminates with rational coefficients (in \({\mathbb{K}}\)). Define \((X_{k})\) by (1.1.5). If \(X_{k}\neq\emptyset\), fix \(\varphi_{k}\in{\cal D}(X_{k+1})\) with \(\varphi_{k}\,|\,X_{k}=1\), and put \(\varphi_{k}:=0\) if \(X_{k}=\emptyset\). Then \(S:=\{\,\varphi_{k}p\ ;\ p\in{\cal P},\ k\in{\mathbb{N}}\,\}\) is a countable subset of \({\cal D}(X)\). It is an easy consequence of Lemma 1.3.7 and the properties of the LF-topology of \({\cal D}(X)\) that \(S\) is dense in \({\cal D}(X)\).

**1.3.9 Corollary** _Suppose that_

\[\mathfrak{F}\in\{\,{\cal D}^{\prime},{\cal E},{\cal E}^{\prime},{\cal S},{ \cal S}^{\prime},{\cal O}_{M},C_{0},C^{k},W_{p}^{k}\ ;\ 1\leq p<\infty,\ k \in{\mathbb{N}}\,\}\ ,\]

_and that \(X={\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) if \(\mathfrak{F}=W_{p}^{k}\). Then \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) is separable if \(E\) is separable._

**Proof** Theorem 1.3.6 implies \({\cal D}(X,E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\). Hence the assertion follows from Proposition 1.3.8.

### Topological Tensor Products and the Kernel Theorem

In the first part of this subsection we collect some facts about tensor products of LCSs. This theory is easily accessible in standard books on linear functional analysis and topological vector spaces, in particular, in [30], [32], and [17]. Thus we are rather brief and do not give proofs. In the second part we prove a version of the kernel theorem. This general abstract theorem will be of fundamental importance for defining bilinear operations on vector-valued distributions.

#### Algebraic Tensor Products

Let \(V\) and \(W\) be vector spaces. A **tensor product** of \(V\) and \(W\) is a pair \((T,\beta)\) consisting of a vector space \(T\) and a bilinear map \(\beta:\,V\times W\to T\) such that

* \(T=\mbox{span}\bigl{(}\mbox{im}(\beta)\bigr{)}\),
* \(\beta({\cal V}\times{\cal W})\) is linearly independent in \(T\), if \({\cal V}\) and \({\cal W}\) are linearly independent in \(V\) and \(W\), respectively.

It can be shown that there exists a tensor product of \(V\) and \(W\) and that it is unique, except for linear isomorphisms. If \((T,\beta)\) is a tensor product of \(V\) and \(W\), we put

\[V\otimes W:=T\ ,\quad v\otimes w:=\beta(v,w)\ ,\qquad(v,w)\in V\times W\ ,\]

which is justified by 'uniqueness'.

**1.4.1 Remarks** **(a)** The tensor product has the following important **universality property**: if \(U\) is a vector space and \(b:\,V\times W\to U\) is bilinear, there exists a

---

unique linear map \(B:\ V\otimes W\to U\) such that the diagram

is commutative.

**Proof** Let \({\cal V}\) and \({\cal W}\) be bases of \(V\) and \(W\), respectively. Then \(\beta({\cal V},{\cal W})\) is a basis of \(V\otimes W\) by (i) and (ii) above. Define \(B\) on \(\beta({\cal V},{\cal W})\) by

\[B(v\otimes w):=b(v,w)\ ,\qquad(v,w)\in{\cal V}\times{\cal W}\ ,\]

and extend it linearly. Then \(B\) has the desired property.

**(b)** Let \(V_{j}\) and \(W_{j}\) be vector spaces and \(A_{j}\in{\rm Hom}(V_{j},W_{j})\) for \(j=1,2\). Then there exists a unique

\[A_{1}\otimes A_{2}\in{\rm Hom}(V_{1}\otimes V_{2},W_{1}\otimes W_{2})\ ,\]

the **tensor product** of \(A_{1}\) and \(A_{2}\), such that

\[(A_{1}\otimes A_{2})(v_{1}\otimes v_{2})=A_{1}v_{1}\otimes A_{2}v_{2}\ , \qquad(v_{1},v_{2})\in V_{1}\times V_{2}\ .\]

**Proof** Since \((v_{1},v_{2})\mapsto A_{1}v_{1}\otimes A_{2}v_{2}\) is a bilinear map from \(V_{1}\times V_{2}\) into \(W_{1}\otimes W_{2}\), the assertion follows from (a).

**(c)** Let \(V_{1}\), \(V_{2}\), and \(V_{3}\) be vector spaces. There exists a linear isomorphism

\[V_{1}\otimes(V_{2}\otimes V_{3})\to(V_{1}\otimes V_{2})\otimes V_{3}\] (1.4.1)

such that

\[v_{1}\otimes(v_{2}\otimes v_{3})\mapsto(v_{1}\otimes v_{2})\otimes v_{3}\ .\] (1.4.2)

This means that tensor products are (canonically) associative (so that parentheses can be omitted).

**Proof** Let \({\cal V}_{j}\) be a basis of \(V_{j}\). Define (1.4.1) by (1.4.2) on the basis \({\cal V}_{1}\otimes({\cal V}_{2}\otimes{\cal V}_{3})\) of \(V_{1}\otimes(V_{2}\otimes V_{3})\) and extend it linearly.

**Basic Examples**

**1.4.2 Examples**

Let \({\mathbb{K}}^{m\times n}\) be the vector space of all \((m\times n)\)-matrices with entries in \({\mathbb{K}}\) and let

\[{\mathbb{K}}^{m}\times{\mathbb{K}}^{n}\to{\mathbb{K}}^{m\times n}\ ,\qquad(x,y) \mapsto[x_{j}y_{k}]_{{1\leq j\leq m\atop 1\leq k\leq n}}\ .\]

---

Then \(\mathbb{K}^{m}\otimes\mathbb{K}^{n}=\mathbb{K}^{m\times n}\). Note that

\[x\otimes y=xy^{\top}\ ,\qquad x,y\in\mathbb{K}^{m}\times\mathbb{K}^{n}\ ,\]

if \(\mathbb{K}^{m}\) and \(\mathbb{K}^{n}\) are identified with \(\mathbb{K}^{m\times 1}\) and \(\mathbb{K}^{n\times 1}\), respectively, and \(a^{\top}\) denotes the **transposed** of \(a\in\mathbb{K}^{r\times s}\) for \(r,s\in\overset{\star}{\mathbb{N}}\). Furthermore,

\[x\otimes y=\langle y,\cdot\rangle x\ ,\qquad(x,y)\in\mathbb{K}^{m}\times \mathbb{K}^{n}\ ,\]

if \(\mathbb{K}^{m\times n}\) and \((\mathbb{K}^{n})^{\prime}\) are identified with \(\mathcal{L}(\mathbb{K}^{n},\mathbb{K}^{m})\) and \(\mathbb{K}^{n}\), respectively.

**(b)**: Let \(S\) be a nonempty set, \(V\) a vector space, and \(\Phi(S)\) a vector subspace of \(\mathbb{K}^{S}\). Define a bilinear map

\[\Phi(S)\times V\to V^{S}\ ,\qquad(\varphi,v)\mapsto\varphi\otimes v\]

by \(\varphi\otimes v(s):=\varphi(s)v\). Then

\[\Phi(S)\otimes V:=\operatorname{span}\bigl{\{}\,\varphi\otimes v\ ;\ \varphi \in\Phi(S),\ v\in V\,\bigr{\}}\]

is the tensor product of \(\Phi(S)\) and \(V\)_in_\(V^{S}\), that is, the span lies in \(V^{S}\) (cf. Subsections V.2.4 of [1] and 1.3).

**Proof** Let \(\varphi_{1},\ldots,\varphi_{n}\) be linearly independent in \(\Phi(S)\) and \(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}\) linearly independent in \(V\). Suppose that there exist \(\xi_{jk}\in\mathbb{K}\) such that \(\sum_{jk}\xi_{jk}\varphi_{j}\otimes v_{k}=0\). Put \(\psi_{k}:=\sum_{j}\xi_{jk}\varphi_{j}\) so that \(\sum_{k}\psi_{k}\otimes v_{k}=0\). Then \(\sum\psi_{k}(s)v_{k}=0\) for each \(s\in S\). This implies \(\psi_{k}=0\) for \(k=1,\ldots,n\) by the linear independence of \(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}\). Since the \(\varphi_{j}\) are linearly independent in \(\Phi(S)\), we see that each \(\xi_{jk}\) is zero.

**(c)**: Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{O}_{M}\}\). Then \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E\), defined by (1.3.17) and (1.3.18), is _the_ tensor product of \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\) and \(E\) in \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\). Similarly, if \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S}\}\) then \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\otimes E\), defined by (1.3.19) and (1.3.20), is the tensor product of \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\) and \(E\) in \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E)\).

**Proof** This follows from (b) by putting \(S:=X\) and \(S:=\mathfrak{F}(X)\), respectively.

**(d)**: Let \(E\) be a Banach space, \(S\) and \(T\) nonempty sets, and \(\Phi(S)\) and \(\Psi(T,E)\) vector subspaces of \(\mathbb{K}^{S}\) and \(E^{T}\), respectively. Define a bilinear map

\[\Phi(S)\times\Psi(T,E)\to E^{S\times T}\ ,\quad(\varphi,\psi)\mapsto\varphi \otimes\psi\]

by \(\varphi\otimes\psi(s,t):=\varphi(s)\psi(t)\). Then

\[\Phi(S)\otimes\Psi(T,E):=\operatorname{span}\bigl{\{}\,\varphi\otimes\psi\ ; \ \varphi\in\Phi(S),\ \psi\in\Psi(T,E)\,\bigr{\}}\]

is the tensor product of \(\Phi(S)\) and \(\Psi(T,E)\)_in_\(E^{S\times T}\).

**Proof** Identify \(E^{S\times T}\) and \((E^{T})^{S}\) by means of

\[\bigl{[}(s,t)\mapsto u(s,t)\bigr{]}\longleftrightarrow\bigl{[}s\mapsto u(s, \cdot)\bigr{]}\ .\]

Then the assertion follows from (b).

---

#### Projective Tensor Products

Let now \(F:=(F,\mathcal{P})\) and \(G:=(G,\mathcal{Q})\) be LCSs. For \((p,q)\in\mathcal{P}\times\mathcal{Q}\) we put

\[p\otimes_{\pi}q(z):=\inf\bigl{\{}\,\sum\!p(f_{j})q(g_{j})\ ;\ z=\sum\!f_{j} \otimes g_{j}\,\bigr{\}}\ ,\qquad z\in F\otimes G\ .\]

This defines a seminorm on \(F\otimes G\), the **tensor product** of the seminorms \(p\) and \(q\). In fact, it is the Minkowski functional of the absolutely convex hull of \(\mathbb{B}_{p}\otimes\mathbb{B}_{q}\) where \(\mathbb{B}_{p}:=[p<1]\). It has the property

\[p\otimes_{\pi}q(f\otimes g)=p(f)q(g)\ ,\qquad(f,g)\in F\times G\ .\] (1.4.3)

Thus the family of the tensor product seminorms is separating. Consequently, it defines a locally convex Hausdorff topology on \(F\otimes G\), the **projective topology**, and

\[F\otimes_{\pi}G:=\bigl{(}F\otimes G,\ \{\,p\otimes_{\pi}q\ ;\ p\in\mathcal{P}, \ q\in\mathcal{Q}\,\}\bigr{)}\]

is the **projective tensor product** of \(F\) and \(G\). We denote by \(F\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}G\) the completion of the LCS \(F\otimes_{\pi}G\).

#### Nuclear Maps and Spaces

A linear map \(N\) from the LCS \(F\) into a Banach space \(E\) is **nuclear** if there exist an equicontinuous sequence \((f^{\prime}_{j})\) in \(F^{\prime}\), a bounded sequence \((b_{j})\) in \(E\), and a summable sequence \((\lambda_{j})\) in \(\mathbb{K}\) such that

\[Nf=\sum_{j}\lambda_{j}\langle f^{\prime}_{j},f\rangle b_{j}\ ,\qquad f\in F\ .\] (1.4.4)

The LCS \(F\) is **nuclear** if each continuous linear map from \(F\) into a Banach space is nuclear. It is **conuclear** if its dual is nuclear.

For the following theorem we recall convention (1.1.10).

**1.4.3 Theorem**: _Let \(X\) be a nonempty open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{O}_{M}\}\). Then \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\) is nuclear and conuclear._

**Proof** If \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S}\}\), this can be found in [10] (also cf. [1] and [2]). As for \(\mathfrak{F}=\mathcal{O}_{M}\), we refer to [12, II.4.4].

#### Projective Tensor Products and Maps of Finite Rank

Lastly, we define an injective linear map by

\[\tau:\,F\otimes G\to\mathcal{L}(F^{\prime},G)\ ,\quad f\otimes g\mapsto \langle\cdot,f\rangle g\ ,\] (1.4.5)

the **canonical injection**. Then we prepare for the proof of the abstract kernel theorem by deriving a series of lemmas.

---

**1.4.4 Lemma**: _Let \(F\) be reflexive and nuclear. Then \(\tau\) is a toplinear isomorphism from \(F\otimes_{\pi}G\) onto the subspace of \({\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\) of maps of finite rank._

**Proof** Given a continuous seminorm \(q\) on \(G\) and a bounded subset \(B^{\prime}\) of \(F^{\prime}\),

\[\sup_{f^{\prime}\in B^{\prime}}q\bigl{(}\tau z(f^{\prime})\bigr{)}\leq\sum_{j} \sup_{f^{\prime}\in B^{\prime}}|\langle f^{\prime},f_{j}\rangle|\,q(g_{j})\ , \qquad z=\sum f_{j}\otimes g_{j}\in F\otimes G\ .\] (1.4.6)

Since

\[f\mapsto p(f):=\sup_{f^{\prime}\in B^{\prime}}|\langle f^{\prime},f\rangle|\]

defines a continuous seminorm on \(F^{\prime\prime}=F\), it follows from (1.4.6) that

\[\sup_{f^{\prime}\in B^{\prime}}q\bigl{(}\tau z(f^{\prime})\bigr{)}\leq p \otimes_{\pi}q(z)\ ,\qquad z\in F\otimes G\ .\]

Hence

\[\tau\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}F\otimes_{\pi}G,{\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\bigr{)}\ .\]

It is obvious that \(\tau z\) has finite rank for \(z\in F\otimes G\). Conversely, suppose that \(T\in{\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\) has finite rank, and let \(g_{1},\ldots,g_{m}\) be a basis of \({\rm im}(T)\). Then

\[Tf^{\prime}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\xi_{j}(f^{\prime})g_{j}\ ,\qquad f^{\prime}\in F^{ \prime}\ ,\]

where

\[\xi_{j}(f^{\prime})=\langle g^{\prime}_{j},Tf^{\prime}\rangle_{G}=\langle T^{ \prime}g^{\prime}_{j},f^{\prime}\rangle_{F^{\prime}}\ ,\qquad f^{\prime}\in F^{ \prime}\ ,\]

the \(g^{\prime}_{j}\in G^{\prime}\) satisfying \(\langle g^{\prime}_{j},g_{k}\rangle=\delta_{jk}\). Since \(T^{\prime}\in{\cal L}(G^{\prime},F)\) by the reflexivity of \(F\), it follows that \(f_{j}:=T^{\prime}g^{\prime}_{j}\in F\) and \(T=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\langle\cdot,f_{j}\rangle_{F}g_{j}\). Hence

\[T=\tau z\qquad\hbox{with}\quad z:=\sum_{j=1}^{m}f_{j}\otimes g_{j}\in F \otimes G\ .\]

This shows that \(\tau\) is a bijection from \(F\otimes G\) onto the subspace of \({\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\) of finite rank operators.

Now let \(p\) and \(q\) be continuous seminorms on \(F\) and \(G\), respectively. Given \(T\in{\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\) of finite rank, let \(z:=\tau^{-1}T\), and let \(\sum f_{j}\otimes g_{j}\) be a representation of \(z\) in \(F\otimes G\). Denote by

\[{\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{p}:=\bigl{\{}\,f^{\prime}\in F^{\prime}\ ;\ |\langle f^{ \prime},f\rangle|\leq 1\ \hbox{for}\ f\in{\mathbb{B}}_{p}\ \bigr{\}}\]

the polar of \({\mathbb{B}}_{p}\). Then

\[\eqalign{p\otimes_{\varepsilon}q(z)&:=\sup_{(f^{\prime},g^{\prime})\in{ \mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{p}\times{\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{q}}\Bigl{|}\sum_{j}\langle f ^{\prime},f_{j}\rangle\langle g^{\prime},g_{j}\rangle\Bigr{|}\cr&=\sup_{f^{ \prime}\in{\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{p}}\sup_{g^{\prime}\in{\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{q }}\bigl{|}\bigl{\langle}g^{\prime},\tau z(f^{\prime})\bigr{\rangle}\bigr{|}= \sup_{f^{\prime}\in{\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{p}}q\bigl{(}\tau z(f^{\prime})\bigr{)} \cr}\]

by the bipolar theorem. Since \(F\) is reflexive, \({\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{p}\) is weakly compact by the Alaoglu-Bourbaki theorem. Hence it is weakly bounded and thus, thanks to Mackey's

---

theorem, bounded in \(F^{\prime}\) (cf. [Hor66], [Jar81], [Tre67], or [Sch71] for these standard theorems from the theory of LCSs).

Observe that \(p\otimes_{\varepsilon}q\), as defined in (1.4.7), is a seminorm on \(F\otimes G\). In the theory of LCSs it is shown that the family \(\{\,p\otimes_{\varepsilon}q\,\,;\,\,p\in{\cal P},\,\,q\in{\cal Q}\,\}\) is a separating family of seminorms on \(F\otimes G\) defining the 'injective tensor product topology' on \(F\otimes G\). Since \(F\) is nuclear, this injective tensor product topology coincides with the projective tensor product topology of \(F\otimes G\) (e.g., [Tre67, Theorem 50.1(f)]). Thus we infer from (1.4.7) that \(\tau^{-1}\in{\cal L}({\cal R},F\otimes_{\pi}G)\), where \({\cal R}\) is the linear subspace of \({\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\) of finite rank operators.

**Approximation by Maps of Finite Rank**

Let \(p\) be a continuous seminorm on \(F\). Then \(\ker(p)\) is a closed linear subspace of \(F\). Hence \(F_{p}:=F/\ker(p)\) is a normed vector space with respect to the quotient norm

\[\widehat{x}:=\widehat{x}_{p}:=x+\ker(p)\mapsto\widehat{p}(\widehat{x}):=\inf \bigl{\{}\,p(y)\,\,;\,\,y\in\widehat{x}\,\bigr{\}}\ .\] (1.4.8)

Observe that \(\widehat{p}(\widehat{x})=p(y)\) for \(y\in\widehat{x}\). Let \(q\) be a second continuous seminorm on \(F\) such that \(q\geq p\). Then \(\ker(q)\subset\ker(p)\) implies that \(\widehat{x}_{q}\mapsto\widehat{x}_{p}\) is a well-defined continuous linear map from \(F_{q}\) into \(F_{p}\) of norm at most one. Let \(\widetilde{F}_{p}\) be the completion of \(F_{p}\). Then we consider \(\widehat{x}_{q}\mapsto\widehat{x}_{p}\) to be a linear map from \(F_{q}\) into \(\widetilde{F}_{p}\), the **canonical map**\(F_{q}\to\widetilde{F}_{p}\).

**1.4.5 Lemma**: _Suppose that \(F\) is nuclear and \(p\) is a continuous seminorm on \(F\). Then there exists a continuous seminorm \(q\geq p\) on \(F\) such that the canonical map \(F_{q}\to\widetilde{F}_{p}\) is nuclear._

**Proof** Since \(F\) is nuclear, the quotient map \(\pi_{p}:\,F\to\widetilde{F}_{p}\) is nuclear. Hence \(\pi_{p}\) has a representation of the form (1.4.4) where \((b_{j})\) is a bounded sequence in \(\widetilde{F}_{p}\). Consequently,

\[p(f)=\widehat{p}(\pi_{p}f)\leq c\sup_{j}|\langle f^{\prime}_{j},f\rangle|=:q(f) \ ,\qquad f\in F\ ,\] (1.4.9)

with \(c:=\sum_{j}|\lambda_{j}|\sup_{j}\|b_{j}\|\). The equicontinuity of the sequence \((f^{\prime}_{j})\) implies that \(q\) is a continuous seminorm on \(F\). By (1.4.8) and (1.4.9) each \(f^{\prime}_{j}\) defines naturally a continuous linear form \(h^{\prime}_{j}\) on \(F_{q}\) of norm at most \(1/c\). Thus, since the canonical map \(F_{q}\to\widetilde{F}_{p}\) is given by

\[\widehat{f}_{q}\mapsto\sum_{j}\lambda_{j}\bigl{\langle}h^{\prime}_{j},\widehat {f}_{q}\bigr{\rangle}_{F_{q}}b_{j}\ ,\]

it is nuclear.

By means of the preceding lemma we can give sufficient conditions for linear operators to be approximable by operators of finite rank.

---

#### 1.4.6 Lemma

_If \(F\) is nuclear, the maps of finite rank are dense in \({\cal L}(F,G)\)._

ProofLet \(p\) be a continuous seminorm on \(F\). Lemma 1.4.5 guarantees the existence of a continuous seminorm \(q\geq p\) on \(F\) such that the canonical map \(S:F_{q}\to\widetilde{F}_{p}\) is nuclear. Hence there exist a summable sequence \((\lambda_{j})\) in \({\mathbb{K}}\) and bounded sequences \(\bigl{(}\widehat{f}^{\prime}_{j}\bigr{)}\) and \(\bigl{(}\widehat{f}_{j}\bigr{)}\) in \((F_{q})^{\prime}\) and \(\widetilde{F}_{p}\), respectively, such that

\[S\widehat{f}=\sum_{j}\lambda_{j}\bigl{\langle}\widehat{f}^{\prime}_{j},\widehat {f}\bigr{\rangle}\widehat{f}_{j}\ ,\qquad\widehat{f}\in F_{q}\ .\]

Thus, letting

\[S_{n}:=\sum_{j=0}^{n}\lambda_{j}\bigl{\langle}\widehat{f}^{\prime}_{j},\cdot \bigr{\rangle}\widehat{f}_{j}\ ,\qquad n\in{\mathbb{N}}\ ,\]

it is obvious that

\[S_{n}\to S\qquad\hbox{in }{\cal L}\bigl{(}F_{q},\widetilde{F}_{p}\bigr{)}\ .\]

Observe that the diagram

is commutative, where \(\pi_{q}\) and \(\pi_{p}\) are the quotient maps. Choose \(f_{j}\in\widehat{f}_{j}\) and put

\[T_{n}f:=\sum_{j=0}^{n}\lambda_{j}\bigl{\langle}\widehat{f}^{\prime}_{j},\pi_{q }f\bigr{\rangle}f_{j}\ ,\qquad f\in F\ .\]

Then, thanks to (1.4.10) and (1.4.11),

\[p(T_{n}f-f)\to 0\ ,\qquad n\to\infty\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(f\) in bounded subsets of \(F\).

Now let \(R\in{\cal L}(F,G)\) and a continuous seminorm \(r\) on \(G\) be given. Then \(p:=r\circ R\) is a continuous seminorm on \(F\). Put \(R_{n}:=R\circ T_{n}\). It follows from (1.4.12) that \(r\bigl{(}(R_{n}-R)f\bigr{)}\to 0\) as \(n\to\infty\), uniformly with respect to \(f\) in bounded subsets of \(F\). Since \(R_{n}\in{\cal L}(F,G)\) has finite rank, the assertion follows.

#### Completeness of Spaces of Linear Operators

In our last preparatory lemma we give conditions for \({\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\) to be complete.

#### 1.4.7 Lemma

_Let \(F\) and \(G\) be complete and let \(F\) be reflexive. Then \({\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\) is complete._

---

**Proof** Let \((T_{\alpha})\) be a Cauchy net in \({\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\). Since \(G\) is complete and \((T_{\alpha}f^{\prime})\) is a Cauchy net in \(G\), there exists \(T\in{\rm Hom}(F^{\prime},G)\) such that \(T_{\alpha}f^{\prime}\to Tf^{\prime}\) in \(G\) for each \(f^{\prime}\in F^{\prime}\). Given \(g^{\prime}\in G^{\prime}\),

\[\langle f^{\prime},T^{\prime}_{\alpha}g^{\prime}\rangle_{F}=\langle g^{\prime}, T_{\alpha}f^{\prime}\rangle_{G}\to\langle g^{\prime},Tf^{\prime}\rangle_{G}=g^{ \prime}\circ T(f^{\prime})\] (1.4.13)

for each \(f^{\prime}\in F^{\prime}\), thanks to \(F^{\prime\prime}=F\). Observe that \((T^{\prime}_{\alpha}g^{\prime})\) is a Cauchy net in \(F\). Hence we deduce from (1.4.13) and the completeness of \(F\) that \(g^{\prime}\circ T\in F\) for each \(g^{\prime}\in G^{\prime}\).

Now suppose that \(g^{\prime}_{\alpha}\stackrel{{ w^{*}}}{{\longrightarrow}}g^{\prime}\). Then

\[g^{\prime}_{\alpha}\circ T(f^{\prime})=\langle g^{\prime}_{\alpha},Tf^{\prime} \rangle_{G}\to\langle g^{\prime},Tf^{\prime}\rangle_{G}\ ,\qquad f^{\prime}\in F^{ \prime}\ .\]

This shows that \({}^{t}T\in{\cal L}(G^{\prime}_{w^{*}},F_{w})\), where \({}^{t}T\) is the algebraic dual of \(T\). Let \(q\) be a continuous seminorm on \(G\). Then \({\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{q}\) is \(w^{*}\)-compact by the Alaoglu-Bourbaki theorem. Hence \(K:={}^{t}T({\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{q})\) is weakly compact as well, thus weakly bounded. Consequently, \(K\) is bounded in \(F\). Hence \(V^{\prime}:=K^{\circ}\) is a neighborhood of zero in \(F^{\prime}\). Observe that \(f^{\prime}\in V^{\prime}\) iff \(|\langle f^{\prime},{}^{t}Tg^{\prime}\rangle_{F}|=|\langle g^{\prime},Tf^{ \prime}\rangle_{G}|\leq 1\) for \(g^{\prime}\in{\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{q}\), that is, iff \(Tf^{\prime}\in{}^{\circ}({\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{q})\), where, given \(C^{\prime}\subset G^{\prime}\),

\[{}^{\circ}C^{\prime}:=\big{\{}\,g\in G\ ;\ |\langle g^{\prime},g\rangle|\leq 1 \ {\rm for}\ g^{\prime}\in C^{\prime}\,\big{\}}\]

is the polar of \(C^{\prime}\) in \(G\). By the bipolar theorem \({}^{\circ}({\mathbb{B}}^{\circ}_{q})=\bar{{\mathbb{B}}}_{q}\). Hence

\[\sup\big{\{}\,q(Tf^{\prime})\ ;\ f^{\prime}\in V^{\prime}\,\big{\}}\leq 1\ .\] (1.4.14)

Since \(V^{\prime}\) is the polar of \(K\), it is absolutely convex and \(w^{*}\)-closed. Thus it is weakly closed by the reflexivity of \(F\). Hence it is closed. Denoting by \(p\) the Minkowski functional of \(V^{\prime}\), it follows that \(f^{\prime}\in V^{\prime}\) iff \(p(f^{\prime})\leq 1\). From this and (1.4.14) we infer that

\[q(Tf^{\prime})\leq p(f^{\prime})\ ,\qquad f^{\prime}\in F^{\prime}\ ,\]

which shows that \(T\in{\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\), thanks to the fact that \(p\) is a continuous seminorm on \(F^{\prime}\).

**The Abstract Kernel Theorem**

After these preparations we can prove the abstract kernel theorem in a form that is most suitable for our purposes.

**1.4.8 Theorem** _Let \(F\) and \(G\) be complete LCSs such that \(F\) is reflexive, nuclear, and conuclear. Then \(\tau\) is_ (_that is, extends to_) _a toplinear isomorphism_

\[\tau:\ F\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}G\to{\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\ ,\] (1.4.15)

_the_ **canonical isomorphism**.

---

**Proof** It follows from Lemma 1.4.7 that \({\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\) is complete. Since \(F\) is conuclear, we infer from Lemma 1.4.6 that the linear subspace \({\cal R}\) of maps of finite rank is dense in \({\cal L}(F^{\prime},G)\). Since \(F\) is also nuclear, Lemma 1.4.4 guarantees that \(\tau\) is a toplinear isomorphism from \(F\otimes_{\pi}G\) onto \({\cal R}\). Now the assertion is an easy consequence of the density of \(F\otimes_{\pi}G\) in \(F\mathbin{\mathaccent 0{\sim}\mskip-4.0mu \otimes}G\) and a well-known result about continuous extensions of continuous linear maps (e.g., [30, Theorem 3.4.2]).

**Tensor Product Characterizations of Some Distribution Spaces**

As a first application of this general theorem we can prove the following characterizations for spaces of vector-valued distributions. They are the basis for defining bilinear maps of vector-valued distributions in the next subsection.

**1.4.9 Theorem** : _Let \(E\) be a Banach space. Then_

\[\mathfrak{F}(X)\mathbin{\mathaccent 0{\sim}\mskip-4.0mu \otimes}E=\mathfrak{F}(X ,E)\cong{\cal L}\bigl{(}\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X),E\bigr{)}\ ,\qquad \mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S},{\cal O}_{M}\}\ ,\]

_and_

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\mathbin{\mathaccent 0{\sim}\mskip-4.0mu \otimes}E= \mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E)={\cal L}\bigl{(}\mathfrak{F}(X),E\bigr{)}\ , \qquad\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S}\}\ ,\]

_where \(\cong\) denotes the canonical toplinear isomorphism._

**Proof** From Theorem 1.1.2 we know that \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\) and \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\) are complete and reflexive. Furthermore, \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\) and \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\) are both nuclear and conuclear, thanks to Theorem 1.4.3. Hence it follows from Theorem 1.4.8 that

\[\tau:\ \mathfrak{F}(X)\mathbin{\mathaccent 0{\sim}\mskip-4.0mu \otimes}E\to{ \cal L}\bigl{(}\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X),E\bigr{)}\]

for \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S},{\cal O}_{M}\}\), and

\[\tau:\ \mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\mathbin{\mathaccent 0{\sim}\mskip-4.0mu \otimes}E \to{\cal L}\bigl{(}\mathfrak{F}(X),E\bigr{)}=\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E)\ .\]

for \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S}\}\) are toplinear isomorphisms. This proves the second assertion and part of the first one. It remains to show that \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\mathbin{\mathaccent 0{\sim}\mskip-4.0mu \otimes}E= \mathfrak{F}(X,E)\). Since \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E\) is dense in \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) by Theorem 1.3.6, we have to verify that \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) induces on \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E\) the projective topology.

Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal E},{\cal S},{\cal O}_{M}\}\) and let \(p\) be one of the seminorms (1.1.3), (1.1.7), or (1.1.9), respectively. Then

\[p(\varphi\otimes e)=p(\varphi)\left|e\right|\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X) \ ,\quad e\in E\ ,\]

where on the left side \(p\) is the seminorm on \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\), and on the right side \(p\) denotes the corresponding seminorm on \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\). From this we easily deduce that \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) induces on \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E\) a topology that is weaker than the projective tensor product topology.

---

Conversely, let \(\sum\varphi_{j}\otimes e_{j}\) be a representation of \(z\in\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E\). Then, given \(\varphi^{\prime}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\) and \(e^{\prime}\in E^{\prime}\),

\[\sum\langle\varphi^{\prime},\varphi_{j}\rangle\langle e^{\prime},e_{j}\rangle= \left\langle e^{\prime},\sum\langle\varphi^{\prime},\varphi_{j}\rangle e_{j} \right\rangle=\left\langle e^{\prime},\left\langle\varphi^{\prime},\sum\varphi_ {j}\otimes e_{j}\right\rangle\right\rangle\,.\]

Consequently (cf. (1.4.7)),

\[p\otimes_{\varepsilon}|\cdot|_{E}(z)=\sup_{\varphi^{\prime}\in\mathbb{R}^{0}_{ p}}|\langle\varphi^{\prime},z\rangle|_{E}\leq p(z)\]

by the bipolar theorem. This shows that the topology induced by \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) on \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E\) is stronger than the injective tensor product topology. Since \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\) is nuclear, the latter coincides with the projective topology.

Finally, given \(K\subset\subset X\), the last string of arguments shows that \(\mathcal{D}_{K}(X,E)\) induces on \(\mathcal{D}_{K}(X)\otimes E\) the projective topology. Since \(\mathcal{D}(X,E)\) induces on \(\mathcal{D}_{K}(X,E)\) its original topology, it follows that \(\mathcal{D}(X,E)\) induces on \(\mathcal{D}_{K}(X)\otimes E\) the projective topology. From

\[\mathcal{D}(X)\otimes E=\varinjlim_{K\subset\subset X}\mathcal{D}_{K}(X)\otimes E\]

(e.g., [1, Corollary 4 to Theorem 15.5.3]) it follows that \(\mathcal{D}(X,E)\) induces on \(\mathcal{D}(X)\otimes E\) the projective tensor product topology. Thus, since \(\mathcal{D}(X)\otimes E\) is dense in \(\mathcal{D}(X,E)\) by Theorem 1.3.6, it follows that \(\mathcal{D}(X)\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E=\mathcal{D}(X,E)\).

Suppose that \(F\) and \(G\) are Frechet spaces such that \(F\) is nuclear. Then

\[(F\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}G)^{\prime}=F^{\prime}\stackrel{{ \sim}}{{\otimes}}G^{\prime}\] (1.4.16)

by means of the duality pairing induced by

\[\langle f^{\prime}\otimes g^{\prime},f\otimes g\rangle:=\langle f^{\prime},f \rangle\langle g^{\prime},g\rangle\;,\qquad(f,g)\in F\times G\;,\quad(f^{ \prime},g^{\prime})\in F^{\prime}\times G^{\prime}\;,\] (1.4.17)

(e.g., [2, Theorem IV.9.9]). By means of this fact we can identify the dual of \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) for \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S}\}\).

**1.4.10 Corollary**: _Let \(E\) be a Banach space and suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{E},\mathcal{E}^{\prime},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{S}^{ \prime}\}\). Then_

\[\mathfrak{F}(X,E)^{\prime}=\left(\mathfrak{F}(X)\stackrel{{\sim}} {{\otimes}}E\right)^{\prime}=\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\stackrel{{ \sim}}{{\otimes}}E^{\prime}=\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E^{\prime})\]

_by means of the duality pairing induced by (1.4.17). If \(E\) is reflexive then \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) is reflexive as well._

There are various versions of the abstract kernel theorem in the textbook literature (e.g., [1, Theorem 21.5.9], [2, Section 50]). However, it is always assumed that \(F\) and \(G\) are Frechet spaces. Since we need to apply Theorem 1.4.8 in the special case that \(F=\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and since \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) is not metrizable, this assumption does not fit our purposes. For this reason we have included a complete proof of Theorem 1.4.8.

### Extending Bilinear Maps

In this subsection we prove a general extension theorem for bilinear maps on tensor products. For this we need a technical lemma guaranteeing a suitable kind of uniformity for equicontinuous sets of nuclear maps.

#### 1.5.1 Lemma

_Let \(F\) be a nuclear LCS and \(E\) a Banach space. Suppose that \(\mathcal{T}\) is an equicontinuous subset of \(\mathcal{L}(F,E)\). Then there exist a summable sequence \((\lambda_{j})\) in \(\mathbb{K}\), an equicontinuous sequence \((f^{\prime}_{j})\) in \(F^{\prime}\), and a bounded map_

\[\mathcal{T}\to B(\mathbb{N},E)\ ,\quad T\mapsto\big{(}e_{j}(T)\big{)}_{j\in \mathbb{N}}\]

_such that_

\[Tf=\sum_{j}\lambda_{j}\langle f^{\prime}_{j},f\rangle e_{j}(T)\ ,\qquad f\in F\ , \quad T\in\mathcal{T}\ .\]

ProofBy the equicontinuity of \(\mathcal{T}\), the set \(\bigcap\{\,T^{-1}(\bar{\mathbb{B}}_{E})\ ;\ T\in\mathcal{T}\,\}\) is a closed absolutely convex neighborhood of zero. Let \(p\) be its Minkowski functional. Then \(p\) is a continuous seminorm on \(F\) and

\[|Tf|_{E}\leq p(f)\ ,\qquad f\in F\ ,\quad T\in\mathcal{T}\ .\] (1.5.1)

The nuclearity of \(F\) implies, thanks to Lemma 1.4.5, the existence of a continuous seminorm \(q\geq p\) on \(F\) such that the canonical map \(S:\ F_{q}\to\widetilde{F}_{p}\) is nuclear. Hence there exist a summable sequence \((\lambda_{j})\) in \(\mathbb{K}\) and bounded sequences \(\big{(}\widehat{f}^{\prime}_{j}\big{)}\) and \((\widehat{g}_{j})\) in \((F_{q})^{\prime}\) and \(\widetilde{F}_{p}\), respectively, such that

\[S\widehat{f}=\sum_{j}\lambda_{j}\big{\langle}\widehat{f}^{\prime}_{j},\widehat {f}\big{\rangle}\widehat{g}_{j}\ ,\qquad\widehat{f}\in F_{q}\ .\] (1.5.2)

It is easy to verify that for each \(T\in\mathcal{T}\) there exists \(\widetilde{T}\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\widetilde{F}_{p},E\big{)}\) such that the diagram

is commutative, where \(\pi_{q}\) is the quotient map. Hence, letting \(f^{\prime}_{j}:=(\pi_{q})^{\prime}\widehat{f}^{\prime}_{j}\) and \(e_{j}(T):=\widetilde{T}\widehat{g}_{j}\), the assertion follows since (1.5.1) and (1.4.8) imply \(\big{\|}\widetilde{T}\big{\|}\leq 1\).

Now we are in a position to prove the following general extension theorem for bilinear maps. Throughout the remainder of this subsection we assume that \(E_{j}\)

---

\(j=0,1,2\), are Banach spaces and

\[E_{1}\times E_{2}\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(e_{1},e_{2})\mapsto e_{1}\bullet e_{2}\] (1.5.3)

is a multiplication. Furthermore, given an LCS \(F\), we put \(F(E):={\cal L}(F^{\prime},E)\) and we remind the reader of the definition of point-wise multiplication in Subsection II.1.1 of [10].

**1.5.2 Proposition**.: _Let \(F_{j}\), \(j=0,1,2\), be LCSs such that_

* \(F_{1}\) _is reflexive, complete, nuclear, and conuclear;_
* \(F_{0}(E_{0})\) _is complete._

_Suppose that there is given a hypocontinuous bilinear map_

\[F_{1}\times F_{2}(E_{2})\to F_{0}(E_{2})\ ,\quad(f_{1},v)\mapsto f_{1}\boxdot v\ .\] (1.5.4)

_Define a bilinear map_

\[\boxdot_{\bullet}\,:\,(F_{1}\otimes E_{1})\times F_{2}(E_{2})\to F_{0}(E_{0})\]

_by_

\[(f_{1}\otimes e_{1},v)\mapsto e_{1}\bullet(f_{1}\boxdot v)\ ,\qquad(e_{1},f_{1}) \in E_{1}\times F_{1}\ ,\] (1.5.5)

_and by bilinear extension otherwise. Then \(\boxdot_{\bullet}\) possesses a unique hypocontinuous bilinear extension_

\[\boxdot_{\bullet}\,:\,(F_{1}\,\,\widetilde{\otimes}\,E_{1})\times F_{2}(E_{2} )\to F_{0}(E_{0})\ ,\quad(u,v)\mapsto u\boxdot_{\bullet}v\ .\]

Proof.: Uniqueness follows immediately from the density of \(F_{1}\otimes E_{1}\) in \(F_{1}\,\,\widetilde{\otimes}\,E_{1}\).

Given \(u:=\sum f_{j}\otimes e_{j}\in F_{1}\otimes E_{1}\) and \(v\in F_{2}(E_{2})\),

\[u\boxdot_{\bullet}v=\sum e_{j}\bullet(f_{j}\boxdot v)\in F_{0}(E_{0})\ .\] (1.5.6)

Let \(B^{\prime}_{0}\) be a bounded subset of \(F^{\prime}_{0}\). Then

\[p(w):=\sup_{f^{\prime}\,\in\,B^{\prime}_{0}}|wf^{\prime}|_{E_{0}}\ ,\qquad w \in F_{0}(E_{0})\ ,\]

and

\[p_{2}(v):=\sup_{f^{\prime}\,\in\,B^{\prime}_{0}}|vf^{\prime}|_{E_{2}}\ ,\qquad v \in F_{0}(E_{2})\ ,\]

define continuous seminorms on \(F_{0}(E_{0})\) and \(F_{0}(E_{2})\), respectively. Hence

\[p(u\boxdot_{\bullet}v)\leq\sum_{j}p_{2}(f_{j}\boxdot v)\,|e_{j}|_{E_{1}}\ .\] (1.5.7)

---

Let \(B_{2}\) be a bounded subset of \(F_{2}(E_{2})\). Then (1.5.7) and the hypocontinuity of (1.5.4) imply the existence of a continuous seminorm \(p_{1}\) on \(F_{1}\) such that

\[p(u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,v)\leq\sum_{j}p_{1}(f_{j})\left|e_{j}\right| _{E_{1}}\ ,\qquad v\in B_{2}\ .\]

Since \(p_{1}\) is independent of the particular representation of \(u\), it follows that

\[p(u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,v)\leq(p_{1}\otimes_{\pi}\left|\cdot\right| )(u)\ ,\qquad u\in F_{1}\otimes E_{1}\ ,\quad v\in B_{2}\ .\]

This shows that

\[(u\mapsto u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,v)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}F_{1} \otimes_{\pi}E_{1},F_{0}(E_{0})\bigr{)}\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(v\) in bounded subsets of \(F_{2}(E_{2})\).

Given \(v\in F_{2}(E_{2})\), there exists a unique continuous extension

\[U_{v}\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}F_{1}\buildrel\sim\over{\otimes}E_{1},F_{0}(E_{0}) \bigr{)}\]

of (1.5.8), thanks to assumption (ii). Then

\[[(u,v)\mapsto u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,v:=U_{v}(u)]\ :\ (F_{1} \buildrel\sim\over{\otimes}E_{1})\times F_{2}(E_{2})\to F_{0}(E_{0})\]

is an extension of (1.5.5) that is trivially linear in the first variable. For \(u\in F_{1}\buildrel\sim\over{\otimes}E_{1}\) choose a net \((u_{\alpha})\) in \(F_{1}\otimes E_{1}\) such that \(u_{\alpha}\to u\) in \(F_{1}\buildrel\sim\over{\otimes}E_{1}\). Then, given \(\lambda_{j}\in{\tenmsb K}\) and \(v_{j}\in F_{2}(E_{2})\) for \(j=1,2\),

\[\eqalign{u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,(\lambda_{1}v_{1}+\lambda_{2}v_{2})& =\lim_{\alpha}\bigl{[}u_{\alpha}\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,(\lambda_{1}v_{1}+ \lambda_{2}v_{2})\bigr{]}\cr&=\lambda_{1}\lim_{\alpha}(u_{\alpha}\,\mathchar 1027 \relax_{\bullet}\,v_{1})+\lambda_{2}\lim_{\alpha}(u_{\alpha}\,\mathchar 1027 \relax_{\bullet}\,v_{2})\cr&=\lambda_{1}(u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,v_{1})+ \lambda_{2}(u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,v_{2})\ .\cr}\]

Thus (1.5.10) is bilinear and it remains to show that it is hypocontinuous.

The uniformity assertion contained in (1.5.8) implies that the family of linear operators (1.5.8) is equicontinuous if \(v\) stays in bounded subsets of \(F_{2}(E_{2})\). Thus, given a closed neighborhood \(V_{0}\) of zero in \(F_{0}(E_{0})\) and a bounded subset \(B_{2}\) of \(F_{2}(E_{2})\), there exists a neighborhood \(V_{1}\) of zero in \(F_{1}\otimes_{\pi}E_{1}\) such that \(u\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,v\in V_{0}\) for \((u,v)\in V_{1}\times B_{2}\). Consequently,

\[U_{v}(\overline{V}_{1})\subset V_{0}\ ,\qquad v\in B_{2}\ ,\]

where \(\overline{V}_{1}\) is the closure of \(V_{1}\) in \(F_{1}\buildrel\sim\over{\otimes}E_{1}\). This shows that \(\{\,U_{v}\ ;\,v\in B_{2}\,\}\) is equicontinuous in \({\cal L}\bigl{(}F_{1}\buildrel\sim\over{\otimes}E_{1},F_{0}(E_{0})\bigr{)}\). Hence \(u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}\,v\to 0\) in \(F_{0}(E_{0})\) as \(u\to 0\) in \(F_{1}\buildrel\sim\over{\otimes}E_{1}\), uniformly with respect to \(v\) in bounded subsets of \(F_{2}(E_{2})\).

---

Now let \(B\) be a bounded subset of \(F_{1}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{1}\). Thanks to assumption (i) and Theorem 1.4.8,

\[F_{1}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{1}\cong{\cal L}(F_{1}^{\prime}, E_{1})=F_{1}(E_{1})\ .\] (1.5.11)

Put \(B_{1}\mathrel{\mathop{:}}=\tau(B)\), where \(\tau\) is the isomorphism of (1.5.11). Then \(B_{1}\) is bounded in \(F_{1}(E_{1})\). Since \(F_{1}^{\prime}\) is barreled, being the dual of a reflexive space, hence reflexive, the uniform boundedness principle shows that \(B_{1}\) is equicontinuous. Thus Lemma 1.5.1 guarantees the existence of a summable sequence \((\lambda_{j})\) in \({\mathbb{K}}\), a bounded sequence \((f_{j})\) in \(F_{1}\), and a bounded set \(C\) in \(E_{1}\) such that each \(u\in B_{1}\) has a representation \(u=\sum_{j}\lambda_{j}f_{j}\otimes e_{j}\), where \(e_{j}\in C\) and the series converges in \(F_{1}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{1}\). Hence, given \(v\in F_{2}(E_{2})\), it follows from (1.5.9), (1.5.10), and (1.5.6) that

\[u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}v=\sum_{j}\lambda_{j}e_{j}\bullet(f_{j}\, \mathchar 1027\relax v)\ .\]

Consequently,

\[p(u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}v)\leq\sum_{j}|\lambda_{j}|\,p_{2}(f_{j}\, \mathchar 1027\relax v)\,|e_{j}|_{E_{1}}\ \ .\] (1.5.12)

From the hypocontinuity of (1.5.4) and the boundedness of the sequence \((f_{j})\) in \(F_{1}\) we deduce the existence of a continuous seminorm \(q\) on \(F_{2}(E_{2})\) such that

\[p_{2}(f_{j}\,\mathchar 1027\relax v)\leq q(v)\ ,\qquad v\in F_{2}(E_{2})\ ,\quad j \in{\mathbb{N}}\ .\] (1.5.13)

Since \(e_{j}\in C\) and \(C\) is bounded in \(E_{1}\), we infer from (1.5.12) and (1.5.13) that

\[p(u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}v)\leq cq(v)\ ,\qquad v\in F_{2}(E_{2})\ , \quad u\in B_{1}\ .\]

This proves that

\[(v\mapsto u\,\mathchar 1027\relax_{\bullet}v)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}F_{2}(E_{2}),F_{ 0}(E_{0})\bigr{)}\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(u\) in bounded subsets of \(F_{1}\,\mathchar 1027\relax\,E_{1}\). Thus the map (1.5.10) is hypocontinuous.

By specializing we deduce from the preceding proposition the following fundamental extension result:

**1.5.3 Theorem** _Let \(F_{j}\), \(j=0,1,2\), be reflexive, complete, nuclear, and nuclear LCSs. Suppose that there are a bilinear map_

\[F_{1}\times F_{2}\to F_{0}\ ,\quad(f_{1},f_{2})\mapsto f_{1}\odot f_{2}\] (1.5.14)

_and a hypocontinuos bilinear map_

\[F_{1}\times(F_{2}\,\mathchar 1027\relax\,E_{2})\to F_{0}\,\mathchar 1027 \relax\,E_{2}\ ,\quad(f_{1},v)\mapsto f_{1}\,\hbox to 0.0pt{$\circ$}v\] (1.5.15)

---

_such that_

\[f_{1}\odot(f_{2}\otimes e_{2})=(f_{1}\odot f_{2})\otimes e_{2}\ ,\qquad f_{j}\in F _{j}\ ,\quad j=1,2\ ,\quad e_{2}\in E_{2}\ .\]

_Then there exists a unique hypocontiuous bilinear map_

\[\odot_{\bullet}\,:\ (F_{1}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{1})\times( F_{2}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{2})\to F_{0}\stackrel{{ \sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{0}\ ,\quad(u,v)\mapsto u\odot_{\bullet}v\]

_satisfying_

\[(f_{1}\otimes e_{1})\odot_{\bullet}(f_{2}\otimes e_{2})=(f_{1}\odot f_{2}) \otimes(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\]

_for \(f_{j}\in F_{j}\) and \(e_{j}\in E_{j}\), \(j=1,2\)._

**Proof** Since \(E_{j}\otimes F_{j}\) is dense in \(E_{j}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}F_{j}\) for \(j=1,2\), there exists at most one separately continuous bilinear map \(\odot_{\bullet}\) from \((F_{1}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{1})\times(F_{2}\stackrel{{ \sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{2})\) to \(F_{0}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{0}\) satisfying (1.5.18).

Thanks to Theorem 1.4.8 we can identify \(F_{j}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{j}\) with \(F_{j}(E_{j})\) by means of the respective canonical isomorphisms. Then it follows from (1.5.16) that, given \(f_{0}^{\prime}\in F_{0}^{\prime}\) and \(v:=f_{2}\otimes e_{2}\in F_{2}\otimes E_{2}\),

\[\eqalign{[e_{1}\bullet(f_{1}\odot v)](f_{0}^{\prime})&=e_{1}\bullet[(f_{1} \odot f_{2})\otimes e_{2}](f_{0}^{\prime})=e_{1}\bullet\langle f_{0}^{\prime}, f_{1}\odot f_{2}\rangle e_{2}\cr&=\langle f_{0}^{\prime},f_{1}\odot f_{2} \rangle(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})=[(f_{1}\odot f_{2})\otimes(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})](f _{0}^{\prime})\cr}\]

for \(f_{1}\in F_{1}\) and \(e_{1}\in E_{1}\). Hence

\[e_{1}\bullet(f_{1}\odot v)=(f_{1}\odot f_{2})\otimes(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\]

for \(f_{1}\otimes e_{1}\in F_{1}\otimes E_{1}\) and \(v:=f_{2}\otimes e_{2}\in F_{2}\otimes E_{2}\). By Proposition 1.5.2 there exists a unique hypocontinuous bilinear extension (1.5.17) of (1.5.15) satisfying

\[(f_{1}\otimes e_{1})\odot_{\bullet}v=e_{1}\bullet(f_{1}\odot v)\ ,\qquad f_{1} \otimes e_{1}\in F_{1}\otimes E_{1}\ ,\quad v\in F_{2}\stackrel{{ \sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{2}\ .\]

Thus (1.5.19) implies (1.5.18).

The results of this subsection are due to L. Schwartz. In fact, they are special cases of much more general theorems given in [Sch57b, chap. II] (also see [Sch57a]).

### Point-Wise Multiplication

As a first application of the general extension result of Theorem 1.5.3 we define point-wise multiplication of a vector-valued smooth function with a vector-valued distribution and study some of its properties.

It is an immediate consequence of Leibniz' rule that for each \(m\in\bar{\mathbb{N}}\) point-wise multiplication induced by (1.5.20),

\[C^{m}(X,E_{1})\times C^{m}(X,E_{2})\to C^{m}(X,E_{0})\ ,\quad(a_{1},a_{2}) \mapsto a_{1}\bullet a_{2}\ ,\] (1.6.1)

is well-defined, bilinear and continuous.

Given \(a\in\mathcal{E}(X)\) and \(v\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X,E)\), we recall that \(av\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X,E)\) is defined by

\[av(\varphi):=v(a\varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(X)\ .\] (1.6.2)

It is easily verified that

\[(\varphi\mapsto a\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}(X)\big{)}\ ,\qquad a \in\mathcal{E}(X)\ .\]

A Characterization of \(\mathcal{O}_{M}\)First we prove a characterization of \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) that extends [1, (III.4.1.9)]. In addition, it explains the name 'space of multipliers' for \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

**1.6.1 Proposition**.: _Suppose that \(a\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). Then_

\[a\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\quad\text{iff}\quad(\varphi\mapsto \varphi a)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}),\mathcal{S}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ .\]

Proof.: Given \(a\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(k,m\in\mathbb{N}\), Leibniz' rule and (1.1.8) imply

\[q_{k,m}(\varphi a)\leq c\max_{|\alpha|\leq m}\sum_{\beta\leq\alpha}\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}}(1+|x|^{2})^{k}\,|\partial^{\beta}\varphi(x)|\,|\partial^{ \alpha-\beta}a(x)|\leq cq_{\ell,m}(\varphi)\] (1.6.3)

for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), where \(\ell:=k+\max\{\,m_{\alpha-\beta}\ ;\ \beta\leq\alpha,\ |\alpha|\leq m\,\}\) and where \(m_{\alpha-\beta}\in\mathbb{N}\) are such that there exists \(c_{\alpha-\beta}\) satisfying \(|\partial^{\alpha-\beta}a(x)|\leq c_{\alpha-\beta}(1+|x|^{2})^{m_{\alpha-\beta }}\) for \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\). This shows that

\[(\varphi\mapsto\varphi a)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}), \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ .\] (1.6.4)

Conversely, let (1.6.4) be true. Then, given \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}\), there exist \(k,m\in\mathbb{N}\) and a positive constant \(c\) such that

\[\|\partial^{\alpha}(\varphi a)\|_{\infty}\leq q_{0,|\alpha|}(\varphi a)\leq cq _{k,m}(\varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ .\]

---

Fix \(\psi\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) such that \(\psi\) equals \(1\) near zero. Since \(\tau_{x}\psi\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\subset{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) for \(x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\), it follows that

\[|\partial^{\alpha}a(x)| =\big{|}\partial^{\alpha}\big{(}(\tau_{x}\psi)a\big{)}(x)\big{|} \leq cq_{k,m}(\tau_{x}\psi)\] \[\leq c\sup_{|\alpha|\leq m\atop|y\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}}(1+|x-y|^{2}) ^{k}\,|\partial^{\alpha}\psi(y)|\leq c(1+|x|^{2})^{k}\] (1.6.5)

for \(x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\), thanks to the trivial inequality \(1+|x-y|^{2}\leq 2(1+|x|^{2})(1+|y|^{2})\). Hence \(a\in{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\).

#### 1.6.2 Corollary

_Suppose that \(a\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\). Then_

\[a\in{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\quad\mbox{iff}\quad(u\mapsto au)\in{\cal L} \big{(}{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\big{)}\ .\]

ProofFor simplicity, we put \({\cal O}_{M}={\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) etc. If \(a\in{\cal O}_{M}\), it follows from Proposition 1.6.1 that \((\varphi\mapsto\varphi a)\in{\cal L}({\cal S})\). Hence the dual of this linear map, which is given by \(u\mapsto au\) for \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}\), satisfies \((u\mapsto au)\in{\cal L}({\cal S}^{\prime})\). Conversely, \((u\mapsto au)\in{\cal L}({\cal S}^{\prime})\) implies \((u\mapsto au)^{\prime}\in{\cal L}({\cal S})\) by the reflexivity of \({\cal S}\). Since the latter dual is the map \(\varphi\mapsto\varphi a\) for \(\varphi\in{\cal S}\), the assertion follows.

#### The General Theorem

Now it is easy to prove the following technical lemma that will be used in the proof of the next theorem, one of the main results of this subsection.

#### 1.6.3 Lemma

_Suppose that \(({\mathfrak{F}}_{1},{\mathfrak{F}}_{2};{\mathfrak{F}}_{0})\) is one of the triplets \(({\cal E},{\cal D}^{\prime};{\cal D}^{\prime})\), \(({\cal E},{\cal E}^{\prime};{\cal E}^{\prime})\), \(({\cal S},{\cal O}_{M};{\cal S})\), \(({\cal O}_{M},{\cal O}_{M};{\cal O}_{M})\), \(({\cal O}_{M},{\cal S}^{\prime};{\cal S}^{\prime})\), \(({\cal E},{\cal E};{\cal E})\), or \(({\cal E},{\cal D};{\cal D})\). Then 'point-wise multiplication'_

\[{\mathfrak{F}}_{1}(X)\times{\mathfrak{F}}_{2}(X,E)\to{\mathfrak{F}}_{0}(X,E)\ ,\quad(a,u)\mapsto au\] (1.6.6)

_is a well-defined hypocontinuous bilinear map._

ProofIt follows from (1.1.8) and (1.1.9) that \(B\) is a bounded subset of \({\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\) iff, given \(\alpha\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\), there exist \(m_{\alpha}\in{\mathbb{N}}\) and \(c_{\alpha}>0\) such that

\[|\partial^{\alpha}u(x)|\leq c_{\alpha}(1+|x|^{2})^{m_{\alpha}}\ ,\qquad x\in{ \mathbb{R}}^{n}\ ,\quad u\in B\ .\] (1.6.7)

Hence (1.6.3) shows that

\[(a\mapsto au)\in{\cal L}\big{(}{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}),{\cal S}({\mathbb{R }}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(u\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\). Since the function defined by \(x\mapsto(1+|x|^{2})^{k}\partial^{\beta}\varphi(x)\) belongs to \({\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) for \(\varphi\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\), \(k\in{\mathbb{N}}\), and

---

\(\beta\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\), it follows from (1.6.3) that, given \(k,m\in\mathbb{N}\) and \(a\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), there exists \(a_{k,\alpha}\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) such that

\[q_{k,m}(au)\leq c\max_{|\alpha|\leq k}\|a_{k,\alpha}\partial^{\alpha}u\|_{\infty }\ .\]

Hence

\[(u\mapsto au)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E),\mathcal{S} (\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad a\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ .\] (1.6.8)

Thus, letting \(M_{u}:=(a\mapsto au)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}),\mathcal{S }(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\), we see from (1.6.8) that

\[(u\mapsto M_{u})\in\mathcal{L}\Big{(}\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E), \mathcal{L}_{s}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}),\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}, E)\big{)}\Big{)}\ .\]

Consequently, \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) being a Montel space, the Banach-Steinhaus theorem guarantees that

\[(u\mapsto M_{u})\in\mathcal{L}\Big{(}\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E), \mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}),\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E) \big{)}\Big{)}\ ,\]

that is, the map \(u\mapsto au\) is continuous from \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) into \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), uniformly with respect to \(a\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\). This proves the assertion for the case \((\mathfrak{F}_{1},\mathfrak{F}_{2};\mathfrak{F}_{0})=(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{O} _{M};\mathcal{S})\).

Given \(a\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and \(u\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), it follows from Leibniz' rule that

\[\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}(au)\|_{\infty}\leq c\Big{\|}\varphi\sum_{\beta\leq \alpha}\partial^{\beta}a\partial^{\alpha-\beta}u\Big{\|}_{\infty}\ ,\qquad \varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ .\]

Thus (1.6.7) implies the existence of \(m\in\mathbb{N}\) such that

\[\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}(au)\|_{\infty}\leq c\sum_{\beta\leq\alpha}\|(1+|x|^ {2})^{m}\varphi\partial^{\beta}a\|_{\infty}\ ,\qquad u\in B\ .\]

This shows that \(a\mapsto au\) maps \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) continuously into \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), uniformly with respect to \(u\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). Similarly, we see that \(u\mapsto au\) maps \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) continuously into itself, uniformly with respect to \(a\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\). This proves the assertion if \((\mathfrak{F}_{1},\mathfrak{F}_{2};\mathfrak{F}_{0})=(\mathcal{O}_{M}, \mathcal{O}_{M};\mathcal{O}_{M})\).

Since \(\operatorname{supp}(au)\subset\operatorname{supp}(a)\cap\operatorname{supp}(u)\) for \(a\in\mathcal{E}(X)\) and \(u\in\mathcal{D}(X,E)\), Leibniz' rule and the properties of LF-spaces easily imply that point-wise multiplication is separately continuous from \(\mathcal{E}(X)\times\mathcal{D}(X,E)\) into \(\mathcal{D}(X,E)\). Now hypocontinuity in the case \((\mathcal{E},\mathcal{D};\mathcal{D})\) follows from the fact that \(\mathcal{E}(X)\) and \(\mathcal{D}(X,E)\) are barreled.

If \((\mathfrak{F}_{1},\mathfrak{F}_{2};\mathfrak{F}_{0})=(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{E}; \mathcal{E})\), the assertion follows from (1.6.1). In all other cases Proposition 1.6.1 and Corollary 1.6.2 guarantee that the map (1.6.6) is well-defined, if this is not obvious anyhow. Moreover, in these cases

\[M_{a}:=(\varphi\mapsto a\varphi)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}_{0}^{\prime} (X),\mathfrak{F}_{2}^{\prime}(X)\big{)}\ ,\qquad a\in\mathfrak{F}_{1}(X)\ ,\]

and \(\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}_{j}^{\prime}(X),E\big{)}=\mathfrak{F}_{j}(X,E), \ j=0,2\), by reflexivity. Thus (1.6.6) is the linear map

\[\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}_{0}^{\prime}(X),\mathfrak{F}_{2}^{\prime}(X) \big{)}\times\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}_{2}^{\prime}(X),E\big{)}\to \mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}_{0}^{\prime}(X),E\big{)}\ ,\quad(a,u)\mapsto u\circ M_{a}\ ,\]

and the assertion follows from Lemma 1.1.1.

---

Now we can extend point-wise multiplication to the case that both factors are vector-valued.

**1.6.4 Theorem** _There exists a unique hypocontinuous bilinear map_

\[{\cal E}(X,E_{1})\times{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{2})\to{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{0})\ ,\quad(a,u)\mapsto a\bullet u\ ,\]

_called_ **point-wise multiplication induced by** (1.5.20), _such that_

\[(\varphi\otimes e_{1})\bullet(\psi\otimes e_{2})=\varphi\psi\otimes(e_{1} \bullet e_{2})\]

_for \(a:=\varphi\otimes e_{1}\in{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{1}\) and \(u:=\psi\otimes e_{2}\in{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{2}\). It restricts to a hypocontinuous bilinear map_

\[{\twelvenm F}_{1}(X,E_{1})\times{\twelvenm F}_{2}(X,E_{2})\to{\twelvenm F}_{0}(X, E_{0})\ ,\]

_where \(({\twelvenm F}_{1},{\twelvenm F}_{2};{\twelvenm F}_{0})\) is any one of the triplets \(({\cal E},{\cal E}^{\prime};{\cal E}^{\prime})\), \(({\cal S},{\cal O}_{M};{\cal S})\), \(({\cal O}_{M},{\cal O}_{M};{\cal O}_{M})\), \(({\cal O}_{M},{\cal S}^{\prime};{\cal S}^{\prime})\), \(({\cal E},{\cal E};{\cal E})\), or \(({\cal E},{\cal D};{\cal D})\)._

**Proof** Let \(({\twelvenm F}_{1},{\twelvenm F}_{2};{\twelvenm F}_{0})\) be as stated or \(({\twelvenm F}_{1},{\twelvenm F}_{2};{\twelvenm F}_{0})=({\cal E},{\cal D}^{ \prime};{\cal D}^{\prime})\), and write \(F_{j}\) for \({\twelvenm F}_{j}(X)\), \(j=0,1,2\). Then the spaces \(F_{j}\) are reflexive, complete, nuclear, and conuclear by Theorems 1.1.2 and 1.4.3. Moreover, \(F_{j}\mathrel{\widetilde{\otimes}}E_{j}={\twelvenm F}_{j}(X,E_{j}),\ j=0,1,2\), thanks to Theorem 1.4.9. Define the bilinear maps (1.5.14) and (1.5.15) by point-wise multiplication. It is easily verified that (1.5.16) is true and it follows from Lemma 1.6.3 that the map (1.5.15) is hypocontinuous. Hence Theorem 1.5.3 guarantees the existence of a unique hypocontinuous bilinear map

\[{\twelvenm F}_{1}(X,E_{1})\times{\twelvenm F}_{2}(X,E_{2})\to{\twelvenm F}_{0}( X,E_{0})\ ,\quad(a,u)\mapsto a\bullet u\]

satisfying (1.6.10) for \(a:=\varphi\otimes e_{1}\in{\twelvenm F}_{1}(X)\otimes E_{1}\) and \(u:=v\otimes e_{2}\in{\twelvenm F}_{2}(X)\otimes E_{2}\). The assertion is now an obvious consequence of the almost trivial fact that the separately continuous bilinear map (1.6.11) is uniquely determined by its restriction to the subspace \(\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{1}\bigr{)}\times\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{2 }\bigr{)}\) that is dense by Theorem 1.3.6.

**Basic Properties of Multiplications**

**1.6.5 Remarks** (a): Since \(E_{2}\times E_{1}\to E_{0}\), \((e_{2},e_{1})\mapsto e_{1}\bullet e_{2}\) is a multiplication as well, the assertions of Theorem 1.6.4 are 'symmetric' with respect to \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\), that is, the roles of \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) can be interchanged. This fact will often be employed in the following, usually without further mention.
**(b):** Point-wise multiplication induced by (1.5.20), as defined in Theorem 1.6.4, coincides on regular distributions with point-wise multiplication in the usual sense. In other words, if \(a\in{\cal E}(X,E_{1})\) and \(u\in L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E_{2})\) then \(a\bullet u\in L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E_{0})\) and

\[a\bullet u(\cdot)=a(\cdot)\bullet u(\cdot)\ .\]

Observe that this justifies the use of the name 'point-wise multiplication' for the bilinear map of Theorem 1.6.4.

---

ProofSince \(L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E_{2})\hookrightarrow{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{2})\), it follows from Theorem 1.6.4 and an obvious estimate that both sides of (1.6.12) are separately continuous bilinear maps

\[{\cal E}(X,E_{1})\times L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E_{2})\to{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{0})\ .\]

Theorem 1.3.6(viii) immediately implies

\[{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{2}\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}L_{1,{ \rm loc}}(X,E_{2})\ .\]

Thus we deduce from (1.6.10) that both sides of (1.6.12) coincide on the dense subspace \(\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{1}\bigr{)}\times\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{2} \bigr{)}\) of \({\cal E}(X,E_{1})\times L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E_{2})\). Hence the assertion follows.

**(c) Leibniz' rule** is valid in the general case as well. More precisely, if \(p\) is a polynomial in \(n\) indeterminates then

\[p(\partial)(a\bullet u)=\sum_{\beta}{1\over\beta!}(\partial^{\beta}a)\bullet p ^{(\beta)}(\partial)u\]

for \(a\in{\cal E}(X,E_{1})\) and \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{2})\), where \(p^{(\beta)}:=\partial^{\beta}p\). In particular:

\[\partial^{\alpha}(a\bullet u)=\sum_{\beta\leq\alpha}{\alpha\choose\beta}( \partial^{\beta}a)\bullet\partial^{\alpha-\beta}u\ ,\qquad a\in{\cal E}(X,E_{1})\ , \quad u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{2})\ .\]

ProofIt follows from \(\partial^{\alpha}\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal E}(X,E_{1})\bigr{)}\) and \(p^{(\beta)}(\partial)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{2})\bigr{)}\) that both sides of (1.6.14) define separately continuous bilinear maps:

\[{\cal E}(X,E_{1})\times{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{2})\to{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{0})\ .\]

Thanks to Lemma 1.3.2 and to property (1.6.10) they coincide on the linear subspace \(\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{1}\bigr{)}\times\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{2}\bigr{)}\). Since, by Theorem 1.3.6(ii) and (v), this subspace is dense in \({\cal E}(X,E_{1})\times{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{2})\), they coincide everywhere.

**(d)**: If \((a,u)\in{\cal E}(X,E_{1})\times{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{2})\) then

\[{\rm supp}(a\bullet u)\subset{\rm supp}(a)\cap{\rm supp}(u)\ .\]

ProofLet \(K:={\rm supp}(a)\) and denote by \(K_{\varepsilon}:=\bigl{\{}\,x\in X\ ;\ {\rm dist}(x,K)<\varepsilon\,\bigr{\}}\) the open \(\varepsilon\)-neighborhood of \(K\) in \(X\) for \(\varepsilon>0\). Choose \(\psi_{\varepsilon}\in{\cal E}(X)\) with \({\rm supp}(\psi_{\varepsilon})\subset K_{\varepsilon}\) and \(\psi|\,K=1\). Since \({\cal E}(X)\otimes E_{1}\) is dense in \({\cal E}(X,E_{1})\), there exists a sequence \((a_{j})\) in \({\cal E}(X)\otimes E_{1}\) converging in \({\cal E}(X,E_{1})\) towards \(a\). Then \(b_{j}:=\psi_{\varepsilon}\,a_{j}\in{\cal E}(X)\otimes E_{1}\) and \({\rm supp}(b_{j})\subset K_{\varepsilon}\). It is easily verified that \({\rm supp}(b_{j}\bullet u)\subset\overline{K}_{\varepsilon}\cap{\rm supp}(u)=: M_{\varepsilon}\) and that

\[{\cal D}^{\prime}_{M_{\varepsilon}}(X,E_{0}):=\bigl{\{}\,v\in{\cal D}^{\prime} (X,E_{0})\ ;\ {\rm supp}(v)\subset M_{\varepsilon}\,\bigr{\}}\]

is a closed linear subspace of \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{0})\). Now we deduce from Theorem 1.6.4 that \(b_{j}\bullet u\to a\bullet u\) in \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{0})\), hence in \({\cal D}^{\prime}_{M_{\varepsilon}}(X,E_{0})\). Consequently, \({\rm supp}(a\bullet u)\subset M_{\varepsilon}\) for each \(\varepsilon>0\), which implies the assertion.

---

**(e)**: Let \(E_{3}\), \(E_{4}\), and \(E_{5}\) be further Banach spaces and suppose that there are multiplications

all denoted by \(\bullet\) , that are associative, that is,

\[(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\bullet e_{3}=e_{1}\bullet(e_{2}\bullet e_{3})\ ,\qquad e_{j} \in E_{j}\ ,\quad j=1,2,3\ .\] (1.6.16)

Then point-wise multiplication is associative as well, when defined, that is,

\[(u_{1}\bullet u_{2})\bullet u_{3}=u_{1}\bullet(u_{2}\bullet u_{3})\ ,\qquad u_{j} \in\mathfrak{F}_{j}(X,E_{j})\ ,\quad j=1,2,3\ ,\] (1.6.17)

where \((\mathfrak{F}_{1},\mathfrak{F}_{2},\mathfrak{F}_{3})=\big{\{}(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{E},\mathcal{D}^{\prime}),(\mathcal{O}_{M},\mathcal{O}_{M},\mathcal{S} ^{\prime})\big{\}}\).

**Proof** : It follows from Theorem 1.6.4 that both sides of (1.6.17) define separately continuous trilinear maps

\[\prod_{j=1}^{3}\mathfrak{F}_{j}(X,E_{j})\to\mathfrak{F}_{3}(X,E_{5})\]

that coincide on the dense linear subspace \(\prod_{j=1}^{3}\mathcal{D}(X)\otimes E_{j}\), hence everywhere.
**(f)**: Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{O}_{M}, \mathcal{D}^{\prime},\mathcal{E}^{\prime},\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\}\). Then the map

\[E_{1}\times\mathfrak{F}(X,E_{2})\to\mathfrak{F}(X,E_{0})\ ,\quad(e_{1},u) \mapsto e_{1}\bullet u:=(1\otimes e_{1})\bullet u\] (1.6.18)

is bilinear and continuous, and

\[\partial^{\alpha}(e_{1}\bullet u)=e_{1}\bullet\partial^{\alpha}u\ ,\qquad \alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\ ,\quad e_{1}\in E_{1}\ ,\quad u\in\mathfrak{F}(X,E_{2})\ .\] (1.6.19)

**Proof** : Since \(1\otimes e_{1}\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\hookrightarrow\mathcal{ E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\), it follows from Theorem 1.6.4 and Remark (a) that (1.6.18) is a well-defined separately continuous bilinear map. Moreover, given \(u=v\otimes e_{2}\in\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E_{2}\) and \(\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\),

\[(e_{1}\bullet u)(\varphi) =\big{[}(1\otimes e_{1})\bullet(v\otimes e_{2})\big{]}(\varphi)= \langle v,\varphi\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}}e_{1}\bullet e_{2}=e_{1} \bullet\big{(}\langle v,\varphi\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}}e_{2}\big{)}\] \[=e_{1}\bullet u(\varphi)\ .\]

Thus the density of \(\mathfrak{F}(X)\otimes E_{2}\) in \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E_{2})\) implies

\[(e_{1}\bullet u)(\varphi)=e_{1}\bullet u(\varphi)\ ,\qquad e_{1}\in E_{1}\ , \quad u\in\mathfrak{F}(X,E_{2})\ ,\quad\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\ .\] (1.6.20)

Consequently, given a bounded subset \(B\) of \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\),

\[\sup_{\varphi\in B}|(e_{1}\bullet u)(\varphi)|_{E_{0}}\leq|e_{1}|_{E_{1}}\sup_ {\varphi\in B}|u(\varphi)|_{E_{2}}\ ,\qquad e_{1}\in E_{1}\ ,\quad u\in \mathfrak{F}(X,E_{2})\ .\]

This proves the continuity of (1.6.18), thanks to Theorem 1.4.9. Lastly, (1.6.19) is a consequence of (c).

---

**(g)**: Let \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S},{\cal O}_{M},{\cal D}^{\prime},{\cal E} ^{\prime},{\cal S}^{\prime}\}\) and consider the multiplication

\[{\cal L}(E,F)\times E\to F\ ,\quad(T,e)\mapsto T\bullet e:=Te\ .\] (1.6.21)

Then it follows from (f) that (1.6.21) induces a continuous bilinear map

\[{\cal L}(E,F)\times\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\to\mathfrak{F}(X,F)\ ,\quad(T,u)\mapsto T \bullet u:=Tu\ .\]

In particular, each \(T\in{\cal L}(E,F)\) induces a continuous linear map via (1.6.21),

\[(u\mapsto T\bullet u)\in{\cal L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(X,E),\mathfrak{F}(X,F) \big{)}\ .\] (1.6.22)

We denote it by \(T\) as well and call it the linear map **induced by \(T\in{\cal L}(E,F)\) via point-wise multiplication**. Moreover, (1.6.19) implies \(\partial^{\alpha}\circ T=T\circ\partial^{\alpha}\) for \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\), that is, the diagram

is commutative for \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\). If \(T\in{\cal L}(E,F)\) is injective, then (1.6.22) is injective as well. Consequently,

\[i:\,E\hookrightarrow F\quad\mbox{implies}\quad i:\,\mathfrak{F}(X,E) \hookrightarrow\mathfrak{F}(X,F)\ .\]

**Proof** We have to prove only the injectivity assertion. Thus suppose that \(Tu=0\) for some \(u\in\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) and that \(T\in{\cal L}(E,F)\) is injective. Then we obtain from (1.6.20) that \(T\big{(}u(\varphi)\big{)}=0\) for each \(\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\). Hence \(u(\varphi)=0\) for each \(\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\), that is, \(u=0\).

**(h)**: Suppose that \(E_{1}=E_{2}=:E\) and multiplication (1.5.20) is symmetric, that is, \(e_{1}\bullet e_{2}=e_{2}\bullet e_{1}\) for \(e_{j}\in E\). Then \(a\bullet u=u\bullet a\) for \(a\in{\cal E}(X,E)\) and \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E)\).

**Proof** This is an immediate consequence of (b), the density of \({\cal D}(X,E)\times{\cal D}(X,E)\) in \({\cal E}(X,E)\times{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E)\), and the separate continuity of point-wise multiplication.

**1.6.6 Corollary**: _Suppose that \((E,\bullet)\) is a \([\)commutative\(]\) Banach algebra and that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S},{\cal O}_{M}\}\). Then \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) is a locally convex \([\)commutative\(]\) algebra with respect to point-wise multiplication, a_ **multiplication algebra**_. Multiplication is continuous if \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S}\}\), and hypocontinuous if \(\mathfrak{F}={\cal O}_{M}\). If \(E\) possesses a unit, \(e_{0}\), then \({\cal E}(X,E)\) and \({\cal O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) possess a unit as well, namely \(1\otimes e_{0}\)._

**Proof** This follows from Theorem 1.6.4, Remarks 1.6.5(e) and (h), appropriate continuous injections given in Theorem 1.3.6, and the fact that hypocontinuous maps are continuous on barreled spaces.

### Scalar Products and Duality Pairings

In this subsection we show, in particular, that, given \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S}\}\), there exists a unique hypocontinuous bilinear map

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E^{\prime})\times\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\to\mathbb{K}\] (1.7.1)

that extends in a natural way the duality pairing \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\times\mathfrak{F}(X)\to\mathbb{K}\). In fact, we consider more general situations that will be needed in the remaining subsections.

**1.7.1 Lemma**: _Let \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S},{\cal D}^{\prime},{\cal E}^{\prime },{\cal S}^{\prime}\}\). Then the bilinear map_

\[\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\times\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\to E\ ,\quad(u,\varphi)\mapsto u (\varphi)\] (1.7.2)

_is hypocontinuous._

**Proof** Since \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime\prime}=\mathfrak{F}\), it follows from Theorem 1.4.9 that \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)={\cal L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X),E\big{)}\). Hence the map (1.7.2) is well-defined and continuous in \(u\), uniformly on bounded subsets of \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\). Thanks to the fact that \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\) is barreled, bounded subsets of \({\cal L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X),E\big{)}\) are equicontinuous by the uniform boundedness principle. Thus (1.7.2) is continuous in \(\varphi\), uniformly with respect to \(u\) varying in bounded subsets of \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\).

It is easy to prove the following general existence theorem that will imply, in particular, the desired extension (1.7.1).

**1.7.2 Theorem**: _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S},{\cal D}^{\prime},{\cal E}^{\prime },{\cal S}^{\prime}\}\). Then there exists a unique hypocontinuous bilinear map_

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E_{1})\times\mathfrak{F}(X,E_{2})\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(u^{ \prime},u)\mapsto\langle u^{\prime}\bullet u\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}}\ ,\] (1.7.3)

_the_ **scalar product induced by multiplication**__(1.5.20), _such that_

\[\big{\langle}(\varphi\otimes e_{1})\bullet(\psi\otimes e_{2})\big{\rangle}_{ \mathfrak{F}}=\langle\varphi,\psi\rangle_{\cal D}(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\] (1.7.4)

_for \(\varphi,\psi\in{\cal D}(X)\) and \(e_{j}\in E_{j}\), \(j=1,2\)._

**Proof** Put \(F_{0}:=\mathbb{K}\), \(F_{1}:=\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X)\), and \(F_{2}:=\mathfrak{F}(X)\). Then the \(F_{j}\) are reflexive, complete, nuclear, and conuclear LCSs. Consequently, Theorem 1.4.9 guarantees that \(F_{2}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{2}=\mathfrak{F}(X,E_{2})\), and it is trivially true that \(F_{0}\otimes E_{0}=F_{0}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{0}=E_{0}\). Define the bilinear maps (1.5.14) and (1.5.15) by \(f_{1}\odot f_{2}:=\langle f_{1},f_{2}\rangle_{F_{2}}\) and \(f_{1}\mathbin{\mathchoice{\vbox{\hbox{\raise 0.43pt\hbox{$\circ$}}}}{\vbox{\hbox{ \raise 0.43pt\hbox{$\circ$}}}}{\vbox{\hbox{\raise 0.43pt\hbox{$\circ$}}}}{\vbox{ \hbox{\raise 0.43pt\hbox{$\circ$}}}}{\vbox{\hbox{\raise 0.43pt\hbox{$ \circ$}}}}}v:=v(f_{1})\), respectively. Then Lemma 1.7.1 shows that (1.5.15) is hypocontinuous. Since it is obvious that condition (1.5.16) is satisfied, Theorem 1.5.3 gives the assertion.

**1.7.3 Remark** Suppose that \(u\in L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E_{1})\) and \(v\in{\cal D}(X,E_{2})\). Then

\[\langle u\bullet v\rangle_{\cal D}=\int_{X}u(x)\bullet v(x)\,dx\ .\] (1.7.5)

---

**Proof** Since \(L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E_{1})\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}{\cal D}^{ \prime}(X,E_{1})\), Theorem 1.7.2 implies that the map

\[L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E_{1})\times{\cal D}(X,E_{2})\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(u,v)\mapsto \langle u\bullet v\rangle_{\cal D}\] (1.7.6)

is bilinear and separately continuous. From (1.6.13) and Theorem 1.3.6 we infer that

\[\big{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{1}\big{)}\times\big{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{2} \big{)}\stackrel{{ d}}{{\subset}}L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E_{1})\times{ \cal D}(X,E_{2})\ .\] (1.7.7)

It is obvious that (1.7.5) is true for \(u\in{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{1}\) and \(v\in{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{2}\). Hence the assertion follows from (1.7.7) and the separate continuity of the map (1.7.6).

**Parseval's Formula**

As a first application of Theorem 1.7.2 we obtain a natural extension of Parseval's formula for the Fourier transform.

**1.7.4 Proposition** _Parseval's formula is valid for vector-valued distributions, that is,_

\[\langle u\bullet\varphi\rangle_{\cal S}=(2\pi)^{-n}\langle\widehat{u}\bullet \stackrel{{\chi}}{{\not\!\partial}}\rangle_{\cal S}\ ,\qquad u\in{\cal S}^{ \prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\ ,\quad\varphi\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2})\ .\] (1.7.8)

**Proof** Thanks to Theorem 1.7.2 and the fact that the Fourier transform and reflection are toplinear automorphisms, it follows that both sides of (1.7.8) are separately continuous bilinear maps from \({\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2})\) into \(E_{0}\). By (1.7.4) and the well-known Parseval formula for scalar distributions the two expressions on either side of (1.7.8) coincide on the dense linear subspace

\[\big{(}{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\otimes E_{1}\big{)}\times\big{(}{ \cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\otimes E_{2}\big{)}\ .\]

Hence they are equal.

**Duality Pairings**

By specializing the above results to the case where (1.5.20) is a duality pairing we obtain the desired map (1.7.1).

**1.7.5 Theorem** _Let \(E\) be a Banach space and let \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S}\}\). Then there exists a unique hypocontinuous bilinear map_

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E^{\prime})\times\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\to{\mathbb{K}}\ , \quad(u^{\prime},u)\mapsto\langle u^{\prime},u\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}(X,E)}\ ,\]

_the_ **duality pairing between \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X,E^{\prime})\) and \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\)**, _such that_

\[\langle u^{\prime},u\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}(X,E)}=\int_{X}\bigl{\langle}u^{ \prime}(x),u(x)\bigr{\rangle}_{E}\,dx\] (1.7.9)

_for \(u^{\prime}\in{\cal D}(X,E^{\prime})\) and \(u\in{\cal D}(X,E)\)._

---

**Proof** Let \(E_{1}:=E^{\prime}\), \(E_{2}:=E\), and \(E_{0}:=\mathbb{K}\), and put \(e_{1}\bullet e_{2}:=\langle e_{1},e_{2}\rangle_{E}\). Then the assertion follows from Theorem 1.7.2 and Remark 1.7.3.

**1.7.6 Remarks**: **(a)** It is also true that

\[\langle u^{\prime},u\rangle_{{\cal D}(X,E)}=\int_{X}\bigl{\langle}u^{\prime}(x ),u(x)\bigr{\rangle}_{E}\,dx\ ,\qquad(u^{\prime},u)\in L_{1,{\rm loc}}(X,E^{ \prime})\times{\cal D}(X,E)\ ,\]

and

\[\langle u^{\prime},u\rangle_{{\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)}=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} \bigl{\langle}u^{\prime}(x),u(x)\bigr{\rangle}_{E}\,dx\ ,\qquad(u^{\prime},u)\in L _{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E^{\prime})\times{\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\]

where \(1\leq p<\infty\).

**Proof** The first part of the assertion is a consequence of Remark 1.7.3. The second one follows from

\[{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E^{\prime})\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow }}L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E^{\prime})\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow }}{\cal S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E^{\prime})\ ,\qquad 1\leq p<\infty\ ,\]

from \({\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}{ \cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), and from the separate continuity of the bilinear map

\[(u^{\prime},u)\mapsto\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\bigl{\langle}u^{\prime}(x),u(x) \bigr{\rangle}_{E}\,dx\]

on \(L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E^{\prime})\times{\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

**(b)** Theorem 1.7.5 contains a more precise description of the duality pairing of Corollary 1.4.10.

### Tensor Products of Distributions and Kernel Theorems

It is the purpose of this subsection to define tensor products of arbitrary vector-valued distributions. These results are of interest for their own sake. In addition, they will be the basis for an important extension of convolutions of vector-valued distributions given in the next section.

**Approximation by Tensor Products**

**1.8.1 Theorem**: _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal E},{\cal S},{\cal D}^{\prime},{\cal E}^{ \prime},{\cal S}^{\prime}\}\) and \(X_{j}\subset\mathbb{R}^{n_{j}}\), \(j=1,2\), are open. Then \({\cal D}(X_{1})\otimes{\cal D}(X_{2},E)\) is sequentially dense in \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\)._

**Proof** Let \(\varphi\in{\cal D}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) be given and put \(K_{j}:={\rm pr}_{j}\bigl{(}{\rm supp}(\varphi)\bigr{)}\), where

\[{\rm pr}_{j}:\,\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\to\mathbb{R}^{n_{j}} \ ,\qquad j=1,2\ ,\]

are the canonical projections. Then \(K_{j}\subset\subset X_{j}\) and there exist \(\psi_{j}\in{\cal D}(X_{j})\) with \(\psi_{j}\,|\,K_{j}=1\). It follows that \(\psi_{1}\otimes\psi_{2}\in{\cal D}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\) and \(\psi_{1}\otimes\psi_{2}\,|\,{\rm supp}(\varphi)=1\).

---

Thanks to Lemma 1.3.7 there exists a sequence \((p_{k})\) of polynomials on \(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\) with coefficients in \(E\), converging in \(\mathcal{E}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) towards \(\varphi\). Then the sequence \(\big{(}(\psi_{1}\otimes\psi_{2})p_{k}\big{)}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\) lies in \(\mathcal{D}(X_{1})\otimes\mathcal{D}(X_{2},E)\) and converges in \(\mathcal{E}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) towards \(\varphi\). Since the supports of \((\psi_{1}\otimes\psi_{2})p_{k}\) are contained in a fixed compact set, the convergence takes place in \(\mathcal{D}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\). It is clear that

\[\mathcal{D}(X_{1})\otimes\mathcal{D}(X_{2},E)\subset\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}) \otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\subset\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\ .\] (1.8.1)

Since \(\mathcal{D}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) is sequentially dense in \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) by [1, Corollary V.2.4.2] and Remark 1.3.4, the assertion follows from (1.8.1) and what has already been proven, provided \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{F}\}\). If \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D}^{\prime},\mathcal{E}^{\prime},\mathcal{F}^{\prime}\}\), we obtain from the already proven facts and Proposition 1.3.3 that

\[\mathcal{D}(X_{1})\otimes\mathcal{D}(X_{2},E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{ \subset}}\mathcal{D}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{ \subset}}\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\]

with sequential density.

**1.8.2 Corollary**: _If \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{D}^{\prime}, \mathcal{E}^{\prime},\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\}\) then \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\) is sequentially dense in \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\)._

**Proof** This is now obvious from \(\mathcal{D}(X_{1})\otimes\mathcal{D}(X_{2},E)\subset\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}) \otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\) and from observation (1.3.16).

### Tensor Products of Distributions

As a preparation for defining tensor products of distributions we establish the following technical result.

**1.8.3 Lemma**: _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}\}\). If \(\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\) and \(u_{1}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1},E)\) then_

\[\big{[}x_{2}\mapsto u_{1}\big{(}\varphi(\cdot,x_{2})\big{)}\big{]}\in \mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\]

_and_

\[\partial^{\alpha}u_{1}\big{(}\varphi(\cdot,x_{2})\big{)}=u_{1}\big{(}\partial _{2}^{\alpha}\varphi(\cdot,x_{2})\big{)}\ ,\qquad\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n_{2}}\ .\]

**Proof** If \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\), let \(K_{j}:=\operatorname{pr}_{j}\bigl{(}\operatorname{supp}(\varphi)\bigr{)}\). Then \(\operatorname{supp}(\varphi)\subset K_{1}\times K_{2}\) and \(K_{j}\subset\subset X_{j}\). From this it follows easily that

\[\big{[}x_{2}\mapsto\varphi(\cdot,x_{2})\big{]}\in\mathfrak{F}\bigl{(}X_{2}, \mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\bigr{)}\ .\]

Now, using \(u_{1}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1},E)=\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}), E\big{)}\), it is not difficult to derive the asserted properties.

---

Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}\}\) and let \(\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\) and \(u_{j}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j})\) be given. Then we put

\[u_{1}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}:=\big{[}x_{2}\mapsto u_{1}\big{(} \varphi(\cdot,x_{2})\big{)}\big{]}\] (1.8.2)

and

\[u_{2}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}:=\big{[}x_{1}\mapsto u_{2}\big{(} \varphi(x_{1},\cdot)\big{)}\big{]}\ .\] (1.8.3)

In other words, the **symbolic notation**\(u_{j}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\) means that the distribution \(u_{j}\) acts on the function following it as a function of the variable \(x_{j}\), the other variable being a free parameter.

It follows from Lemma 1.8.3 and Theorem 1.7.2 that, given \(u_{j}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j})\), \(j=1,2\), and \(\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\),

\[\big{\langle}u_{1}\bullet u_{2}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\big{\rangle} _{\mathfrak{F}}\ ,\quad\big{\langle}u_{2}\bullet u_{1}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2}) \big{)}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}}\] (1.8.4)

are well-defined elements of \(E_{0}\).

Now we are prepared for the proof of the main result of this subsection.

1.8.4 Theorem: _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}\}\). Given \(u_{j}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j})\), \(j=1,2\), there exists a unique distribution \(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E_{0})\), the_ **tensor product of \(u_{1}\) and \(u_{2}\) with respect to the multiplication** (1.5.20), _satisfying_

\[u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})=u_{1}(\varphi_{1}) \bullet u_{2}(\varphi_{2})\ ,\qquad\varphi_{j}\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{j})\ ,\] (1.8.5)

_such that the map_

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1},E_{1})\times\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{2},E_{2}) \to\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E_{0})\ ,\quad(u_{1},u_{2}) \mapsto u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}\] (1.8.6)

_is bilinear and hypocontinuous. It can be evaluated by_ **Fubini's rule**_:_

\[u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi)=\big{\langle}u_{1}\bullet u_{2}\big{(} \varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}}=\big{\langle}u_{1} \big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\bullet u_{2}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}^{ \prime}}\] (1.8.7)

_for \(\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\)._

**Proof** Put \(X_{0}:=X_{1}\times X_{2}\) and \(F_{j}:=\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{j})\), \(j=0,1,2\). Then the \(F_{j}\) satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 1.5.3 and \(F_{j}\mathaccent 869{\otimes}E_{j}=\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j})\), \(j=0,1,2\), by Theorem 1.4.9. Define the maps (1.5.14) and (1.5.15) by

\[\varphi\mapsto f_{1}\odot f_{2}(\varphi):=\big{\langle}f_{1},f_{2}\big{(} \varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}}\]

and

\[\varphi\mapsto f_{1}\mathaccent 869{\otimes}v(\varphi)\ :=v\big{(}f_{1}\big{(} \varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\big{)}\]

for \(\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{0})\), respectively. It follows from Lemma 1.8.3 that they are well-defined. From that lemma we also infer that

\[T_{f_{1}}:=\big{[}\varphi\mapsto f_{1}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},\cdot)\big{)}\big{]} \in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(X_{0}),\mathfrak{F}(X_{2})\big{)}\ .\] (1.8.8)

---

Thus, since \(f_{1}\odot v=v\circ T_{f_{1}}\), we obtain from Lemma 1.1.1 that the map (1.5.15) is hypocontinuous. Given \(f_{j}\in F_{j},\ \varphi_{j}\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{j}),\ j=1,2\), and \(e_{2}\in E_{2}\), it is clear that

\[[f_{1}\odot(f_{2}\otimes e_{2})](\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})=\langle f_{1}, \varphi_{1}\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}}\langle f_{2},\varphi_{2}\rangle_{\mathfrak{F }}e_{2}=[(f_{1}\odot f_{2})\otimes e_{2}](\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})\ .\]

Since \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2})\) is dense in \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{0})\) by Corollary 1.8.2, we infer that condition (1.5.16) is satisfied. Now the first part of the assertion follows from Theorem 1.5.3.

From Lemma 1.8.3 we deduce that

\[[\varphi\mapsto u_{j}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}]\in\mathcal{L}\big{(} \mathfrak{F}(X_{0}),\mathfrak{F}(X_{3-j},E_{3-j})\big{)}\ ,\ \ \ \ \ u_{j}\in \mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j})\ ,\ \ j=1,2\ .\]

Hence, given \(\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{0})\), Theorem 1.7.2 guarantees the existence of hypocontinuous scalar products \(\big{\langle}u_{1}\bullet u_{2}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\big{\rangle} _{\mathfrak{F}}\) and \(\big{\langle}u_{1}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\bullet u_{2}\big{\rangle} _{\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}}\) satisfying

\[\big{\langle}(f_{1}\otimes e_{1})\bullet(f_{2}\otimes e_{2})\big{(}\varphi(x_{ 1},x_{2})\big{)}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}}=\big{\langle}f_{1},f_{2}\big{(} \varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}}(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\]

and

\[\big{\langle}(f_{1}\otimes e_{1})\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\bullet(f_{ 2}\otimes e_{2})\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}}=\big{\langle}f_{1}\big{(} \varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)},f_{2}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}}(e_{1} \bullet e_{2})\]

for \(u_{j}:=f_{j}\otimes e_{j}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{j})\otimes E_{j},\ \ j=1,2\), respectively. Choosing \(\varphi:=\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2}\) in \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2})\), we see that

\[\begin{split}\big{\langle}u_{1}\bullet u_{2}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1} ,x_{2})\big{)}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}}&=\big{\langle}u_{1} \big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\bullet u_{2}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}^{ \prime}}\\ &=\langle f_{1},\varphi_{1}\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}}\langle f_{2}, \varphi_{2}\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}}(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\\ &=\big{(}\langle f_{1},\varphi_{1}\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}}e_{1} \big{)}\bullet\big{(}\langle f_{2},\varphi_{2}\rangle_{\mathfrak{F}}e_{2} \big{)}\\ &=u_{1}(\varphi_{1})\bullet u_{2}(\varphi_{2})=u_{1}\otimes_{ \bullet}u_{2}(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})\ .\end{split}\] (1.8.9)

From \(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{0},E_{0})\), from (1.8.8), and from Theorem 1.7.2 we infer that each one of the trilinear maps

\[\mathfrak{F}(X_{0})\times\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1},E_{1})\times\mathfrak{F} ^{\prime}(X_{2},E_{2})\to E_{0}\]

sending \((\varphi,u_{1},u_{2})\)

\[\text{to }u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi)\ ,\quad\text{to }\big{\langle}u_{1} \bullet u_{2}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\big{\rangle}_{\mathfrak{F}}\ ,\quad\text{or to }\big{\langle}u_{1}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\big{)}\bullet u_{2}\big{\rangle}_{ \mathfrak{F}^{\prime}}\ ,\]

respectively, is separately continuous. By (1.8.9) they are all equal on the linear subspace

\[\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2})\big{)}\times\big{(} \mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes E_{2}\big{)}\times\big{(}\mathfrak{F}^{ \prime}(X_{2})\otimes E_{2}\big{)}\ ,\]

which is dense by Theorem 1.3.6 and Corollary 1.8.2. Hence they are all equal, that is, Fubini's rule is valid.

---

**Basic Properties**

**1.8.5 Remarks**:
**(a)**: If \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j}),\;\;j=1,2,\) then

\[\mbox{supp}(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2})\subset\mbox{supp}(u_{1})\times\mbox{ supp}(u_{2})\]

with equality, provided \(e_{1}\bullet e_{2}\neq 0\) whenever \(e_{j}\in\mbox{\Large$\stackrel{{\mbox{\large$\sharp$}}}{{E_{j}}}$}.\)

**Proof** Let \(A_{j}:=\mbox{supp}(u_{j}).\) If \(\mbox{supp}(\varphi)\subset{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times A_{2}^{\varepsilon}\) then

\[u_{2}\bigl{(}\varphi(x_{1},x_{2})\bigr{)}=0\ ,\qquad x_{1}\in X_{1}\ ,\]

hence \(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi)=0\) by Fubini's rule. Similarly, we see that \(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi)=0\) if \(\mbox{supp}(\varphi)\subset A_{1}^{\varepsilon}\times{\mathbb{R}}^{n_{2}}\). Consequently, \(\mbox{supp}(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2})\subset A_{1}\times A_{2}.\) On the other hand, given \((x_{1},x_{2})\in A_{1}\times A_{2}\) and any product neighborhood \(U_{1}\times U_{2}\) of \((x_{1},x_{2})\) in \(X_{1}\times X_{2}\), there exist \(\varphi_{j}\in{\cal D}(U_{j})\) such that \(u_{j}(\varphi_{j})\neq 0.\) Hence

\[u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})=u_{1}(\varphi_{1}) \bullet u_{2}(\varphi_{2})\neq 0\]

if \(e_{1}\bullet e_{2}\neq 0\) for \(e_{j}\in\mbox{\Large$\stackrel{{\mbox{\large$\sharp$}}}{{E_{j}}}$}.\)
**(b)**: Given \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j})\),

\[\partial_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}\partial_{2}^{\alpha_{2}}(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2} )=(\partial_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}u_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}(\partial_{2}^{\alpha_{2}}u _{2})\ ,\qquad\alpha_{j}\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n_{j}}\ .\] (1.8.10)

**Proof** It follows from Theorem 1.8.4 and the continuity properties of the derivative that both sides of (1.8.10) define separately continuous bilinear maps from \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1},E_{1})\times{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2},E_{2})\) into \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E_{0}).\) From (1.8.5) it is obvious that they coincide on the dense linear subspace \(\bigl{(}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes E_{1}\bigr{)}\times\bigl{(}{\cal D}^{ \prime}(X_{2})\otimes E_{2}\bigr{)}\), hence everywhere.
**(c)**: Let the associativity hypotheses of Remark 1.6.5(e) be satisfied and let \(X_{3}\) be a nonempty open subset of \({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{3}}\). Then

\[(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2})\otimes_{\bullet}u_{3}=u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}(u_ {2}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{3})\ ,\qquad u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j})\ ,\quad j =1,2,3\ .\] (1.8.11)

**Proof** By Theorem 1.8.4 both sides of (1.8.11) define separately continuous trilinear maps

\[\prod_{j=1}^{3}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j})\to{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X _{2}\times X_{3},E_{5})\ .\]

By (1.8.5), Remark 1.4.1(c), and Example 1.4.2(c) they coincide on the dense linear subspace \(\prod_{j=1}^{3}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{j})\otimes E_{j}\), hence everywhere.
**(d)**: If \(u_{j}\in L_{1,\mbox{\scriptsize loc}}(X_{j},E_{j})\) then \(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}\in L_{1,\mbox{\scriptsize loc}}(X_{1}\times X_{2} ,E_{0})\) and

\[u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})=u_{1}(x_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}(x_ {2})\qquad\mbox{for a.a.}\ (x_{1},x_{2})\in X_{1}\times X_{2}\ .\]

**Proof** This follows easily from (1.8.7) and the classical Fubini theorem.

---

**(e)**: _Distributivity_ Suppose that

are multiplications between Banach spaces, all denoted by \(\bullet\). Also suppose that

\[(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\bullet(e_{3}\bullet e_{4})=(e_{1}\bullet e_{3})\bullet(e_{2 }\bullet e_{4})\ ,\qquad e_{j}\in E_{j}\ ,\quad j=1,\ldots,4\ ,\]

and \(a_{j}\in{\cal E}(X_{j},E_{j})\) and \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j+2})\), \(\ j=1,2\). Then

\[(a_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}a_{2})\bullet(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2})=(a_{1} \bullet u_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}(a_{2}\bullet u_{2})\ .\] (1.8.12)

ProofFirst we note that, thanks to (d), \(a_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}a_{2}\in{\cal E}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E_{0})\). Hence Theorems 1.8.4 and 1.6.4 guarantee that both sides of (1.8.12) are well-defined quadrilateral separately continuous maps from

\[{\cal E}(X_{1},E_{1})\times{\cal E}(X_{2},E_{2})\times{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}, E_{3})\times{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2},E_{4})\]

into \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E_{8})\). It follows from (1.8.5) and (d) that they coincide on the dense linear subspace

\[\big{(}{\cal E}(X_{1})\otimes E_{1}\big{)}\times\big{(}{\cal E}(X_{2})\otimes E _{2}\big{)}\times\big{(}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes E_{3}\big{)}\times \big{(}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\otimes E_{4}\big{)}\ ,\]

hence everywhere.

**(f)**: Let \(F_{j}\), \(\ j=0,1,2\), be Banach spaces and suppose that

\[F_{1}\times F_{2}\to F_{0}\ ,\quad(f_{1},f_{2})\mapsto f_{1}\bullet f_{2}\]

is a multiplication. Also suppose that \(T_{j}\in{\cal L}(E_{j},F_{j})\), \(\ j=0,1,2\), satisfy

\[(T_{1}e_{1})\bullet(T_{2}e_{2})=T_{0}(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\ ,\qquad e_{j}\in E _{j}\ ,\quad j=1,2\ ,\]

that is, the diagram

\(E_{1}\times E_{2}\)\(E_{0}\)\(T_{1}\)\(T_{2}\)\(F_{1}\times F_{2}\)\(F_{0}\)\(F_{1}\times F_{2}\)\(F_{0}\)\(F_{1}\times F_{2}\)\(F_{2}\times F_{3}\)\(F_{4}\times F_{5}\)\(F_{6}\times F_{7}\)\(F_{1}\times F_{2}\)\(F_{3}\times F_{4}\)\(F_{5}\times F_{6}\)\(F_{7}\times F_{8}\)\(F_{1}\times F_{2}\)\(F_{3}

---

is commutative. Then, given \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}\}\), the diagram

is commutative as well.

**Proof** We have to show that

\[(T_{1}u_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}(T_{2}u_{2})=T_{0}(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2})\ , \qquad u_{j}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{j},E_{j})\ ,\quad j=1,2\ .\]

From Remark 1.6.5(g) and Theorem 1.8.4 we infer that both sides of this equality define separately continuous bilinear maps that coincide on the dense linear subspace \(\big{(}\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes E_{1}\big{)}\times\big{(}\mathfrak{F }^{\prime}(X_{2})\otimes E_{2}\big{)}\). Thus they are equal.

### Examples

Finally, we include a few simple examples demonstrating the usefulness of tensor products.

#### 1.8.6 Examples

**(a)** The Dirac distribution \(\delta\in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) is the \(n\)-fold tensor product of the 'one-dimensional' Dirac distribution \(\delta\in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R})\). Thus, in **symbolic notation**,

\[\delta(x)=\delta(x_{1})\otimes\delta(x_{2})\otimes\cdots\otimes\delta(x_{n})\ ,\qquad x=(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\]

where \(\delta(y):=\delta\in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{m})\) for \(y\in\mathbb{R}^{m}\) and \(\otimes\) is the tensor product induced by the standard multiplication in \(\mathbb{K}\).

**(b)** Suppose that \(n=n_{1}+n_{2}\) with \(0\leq n_{1}\leq n-1\). Let \(X_{1}\) be open in \(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}\) and let \(X_{2}\) be a nonempty open cube in \(\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\). Also suppose that \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) satisfies \(\partial_{j}u=0,\ \ n_{1}+1\leq j\leq n\). Then \(u=u_{1}\otimes 1_{X_{2}}\) for some \(u_{1}\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X_{1},E)\), where \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\{0\},E):=E\). Lastly, \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X,E)\) is constant if \(\partial_{j}u=0\) for \(1\leq j\leq n\) and \(X\) is connected.

**Proof** (i) First we consider the case \(n_{1}=0\) and \(n=1\). Thus \(X\) is a nonempty open interval in \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X,E)\) satisfies \(\partial u=0\). Fix any \(\varphi_{0}\in\mathcal{D}(X)\) with \(\langle 1,\varphi_{0}\rangle=1\). Then, given \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(X)\), put \(\psi:=\varphi-\langle 1,\varphi\rangle\varphi_{0}\in\mathcal{D}(X)\). Let

\[\chi(x):=\int_{-\infty}^{x}\psi(t)\,dt\ ,\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}\ ,\]

and observe that \(\chi\in\mathcal{D}(X)\). Consequently,

\[0=(\partial u)(\chi)=-u(\partial\chi)=-u(\psi)=\langle 1,\varphi\rangle u( \varphi_{0})-u(\varphi)\ ,\]

which shows that \(u=u(\varphi_{0})1_{X}\), that is, \(u\) is constant.

---

(ii) If \(Y_{j}\) are open subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^{m_{j}}\) for \(j=0,1,2\) and \(Y_{0}:=Y_{1}\times Y_{2}\), then \(\mathbf{1}_{Y_{0}}=\mathbf{1}_{Y_{1}}\otimes\mathbf{1}_{Y_{2}}\). Using this fact and induction, it suffices to consider the case \(n_{2}=1\).

Given \(\varphi_{1}\in\mathcal{D}(X_{1})\), it is easily verified that

\[u_{\varphi_{1}}:=\big{(}\varphi_{2}\mapsto u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2}) \big{)}\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\ .\] (1.8.13)

By assumption, \(\partial u_{\varphi_{1}}=0\). Hence (i) implies the existence of \(e(\varphi_{1})\in E\) such that \(u_{\varphi_{1}}=e(\varphi_{1})\mathbf{1}_{X_{2}}\). Consequently,

\[u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})=e(\varphi_{1})\langle\mathbf{1}_{X_{2}}, \varphi_{2}\rangle\ ,\qquad\varphi_{2}\in\mathcal{D}(X_{2})\ .\] (1.8.14)

Now fix \(\varphi_{2}\in\mathcal{D}(X_{2})\) with \(\langle\mathbf{1}_{X_{2}},\varphi_{2}\rangle=1\) and note that

\[u_{1}:=\big{(}\varphi_{1}\mapsto u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})\big{)}\in \mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X_{1},E)\ .\]

By (1.8.14) we see that \(u_{1}(\varphi_{1})=e(\varphi_{1})\) so that

\[u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})=u_{1}(\varphi_{1})\langle\mathbf{1}_{X_{2}}, \varphi_{2}\rangle\ ,\qquad\varphi_{j}\in\mathcal{D}(X_{j})\ .\]

Now the assertion follows from Theorem 1.8.4.

(iii) If \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X,E)\) satisfies \(\partial_{j}u=0\) for \(1\leq j\leq n\), we infer from (ii) that each point \(x\in X\) has a neighborhood \(U_{x}\) in \(X\) such that \(u\,|\,U_{x}=e_{x}\mathbf{1}_{U_{x}}\) for some \(e_{x}\in E\). If \(U_{x}\cap U_{y}\neq\emptyset\) then it follows from

\[e_{x}\langle\mathbf{1},\varphi\rangle=u(\varphi)=e_{y}\langle\mathbf{1}, \varphi\rangle\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(U_{x}\cap U_{y})\ ,\]

that \(e_{x}=e_{y}\). Let \(x\) and \(y\) be any two points in \(X\). Since \(X\) is connected there is a continuous path \(\gamma:\,[0,1]\to X\) connecting \(x\) and \(y\). Since \(\gamma([0,1])\subset\bigcup_{x\in X}U_{x}\) and \(\gamma([0,1])\) is compact and connected, we can find a finite chain \(U_{0},U_{1},\ldots,U_{m}\) of these neighborhoods covering \(\gamma([0,1])\) and satisfying \(U_{j-1}\cap U_{j}=\emptyset\). Then the above considerations imply that \(e_{x}=e_{y}\) for \(x,y\in X\), so that \(u=e\otimes\mathbf{1}_{X}\) for some \(e\in E\).
**(c)**: Let \(\Theta:=\chi_{\mathbb{R}^{+}}\in L_{1,\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R})\) be the **Heaviside function**. Then

\[\chi_{P}:=\underbrace{\chi_{\mathbb{R}^{+}}\otimes\cdots\otimes\chi_{\mathbb{ R}^{+}}}_{n}\]

is the characteristic function of the natural positive cone \(P:=(\mathbb{R}^{+})^{n}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\). Since \(\partial\Theta=\delta\), we deduce from Remark 1.8.5(b) and from (a) that

\[\partial_{1}\cdots\partial_{n}\chi_{P}=\partial\chi_{\mathbb{R}^{+}}\otimes \cdots\otimes\partial\chi_{\mathbb{R}^{+}}=\delta(x_{1})\otimes\cdots\otimes \delta(x_{n})=\delta(x)\ .\]
**(d)**: Suppose that \(n=n_{1}+n_{2}\) with \(0\leq n_{1}\leq n-1\), and that \(u\in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) has its support in \(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}\times\{0\}\). Then there exist \(m\in\mathbb{N}\) and \(u_{\alpha}\in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}},E)\) for \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n_{2}}\) with \(|\alpha|\leq m\) such that

\[u=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m}u_{\alpha}\otimes\partial^{\alpha}\delta(x_{2})\ ,\qquad x _{2}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\ .\]

This representation is unique.

---

**Proof** Since \(u\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), there exist \(m\in{\mathbb{N}}\) and \(K\subset\subset{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) such that

\[|u(\varphi)|\leq cp_{m,K}(\varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\ .\]

Let \(\{\,\varphi_{\varepsilon}\ ;\ \varepsilon>0\,\}\) be a mollifier on \({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{2}}\). Then, putting \(\ell:=n_{2}\) and

\[\psi_{\varepsilon}:=\varphi_{\varepsilon/4}*\chi_{(\varepsilon/2){\mathbb{B}}^ {\ell}}\ ,\qquad\varepsilon>0\ ,\]

it is easily verified that \(\psi_{\varepsilon}\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{2}}\,)\) satisfies \(\psi_{\varepsilon}(0)=1\), \(\ {\rm supp}(\psi_{\varepsilon})\subset\varepsilon{\mathbb{B}}^{n_{2}}\), and

\[\|\partial^{\alpha}\psi_{\varepsilon}\|_{\infty}\leq c(\alpha,n_{2}) \varepsilon^{-|\alpha|}\ ,\qquad\alpha\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n_{2}}\ ,\quad \varepsilon>0\ .\]

Thus, given \(\varphi_{j}\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{j}}\,)\), \(\ j=1,2\), we see that \(\varphi_{1}\otimes(1-\psi_{\varepsilon})\varphi_{2}\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n _{1}}\times{\mathbb{R}}^{n_{2}}\,)\) has its support in \({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{1}}\times({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{2}}\,)^{\bullet}\). Consequently,

\[u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})=u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\psi_{\varepsilon}\varphi _{2})+u\big{(}\varphi_{1}\otimes(1-\psi_{\varepsilon})\varphi_{2}\big{)}=u( \varphi_{1}\otimes\psi_{\varepsilon}\varphi_{2})\ ,\qquad\varepsilon>0\ ,\]

thanks to \({\rm supp}(u)\subset{\mathbb{R}}^{n_{1}}\times\{0\}\). Hence we infer from (1.8.15) and (1.8.16) that

\[\eqalign{|u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})|&\leq cp_{m,K}(\varphi_{1}\otimes \psi_{\varepsilon}\varphi_{2})\cr&\leq c\max_{|\alpha_{1}|+|\alpha_{2}|\leq m} p_{K_{1}}(\partial^{\alpha_{1}}\varphi_{1})p_{\varepsilon{\mathbb{B}}^{\ell}} \left(\partial^{\alpha_{2}}(\psi_{\varepsilon}\varphi_{2})\right)\cr&\leq c \max_{|\alpha_{1}|\leq m}p_{K_{1}}(\partial^{\alpha_{1}}\varphi_{1})\sum_{| \beta|\leq m-|\alpha_{1}|}\varepsilon^{|\beta|-m+|\alpha_{1}|}p_{\varepsilon{ \mathbb{B}}^{\ell}}(\partial^{\beta}\varphi_{2})\ ,}\]

where \(K_{1}\) is the canonical projection of \(K\) into \({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{1}}\).

Now suppose that \(\partial^{\alpha}\varphi_{2}(0)=0\) for \(|\alpha|\leq m\). Then Taylor's theorem implies

\[|\partial^{\beta}\varphi_{2}(x_{2})|\leq\varepsilon^{m-|\alpha_{1}|-|\beta|} \sum_{|\gamma|=m-|\alpha_{1}|}p_{\varepsilon{\mathbb{B}}^{\ell}}\left(\partial ^{\gamma}\varphi_{2}\right)\,,\qquad\varepsilon>0\ ,\quad x_{2}\in\varepsilon{ \mathbb{B}}^{\ell}\ ,\]

for \(|\beta|\leq m-|\alpha_{1}|\) and \(|\alpha_{1}|\leq m\). Thus we deduce from (1.8.17) that

\[|u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})|\leq cp_{m,K_{1}}(\varphi_{1})p_{m, \varepsilon{\mathbb{B}}^{\ell}}\left(\varphi_{2}\right)\,,\qquad\varepsilon>0\ ,\]

for \(\varphi_{j}\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{j}}\,)\), \(\ j=1,2\), with \(\partial^{\alpha}\varphi_{2}(0)=0\) for \(|\alpha|\leq m\). Observe that the right-hand side of the last estimate tends to zero as \(\varepsilon\to 0\) thanks to \(\partial^{\alpha}\varphi_{2}(0)=0\) for \(|\alpha|\leq m\). Consequently,

\[u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})=0\quad\hbox{for}\quad\varphi_{j}\in{\cal E}({ \mathbb{R}}^{n_{j}}\,)\qquad\hbox{with}\quad\partial^{\alpha}\varphi_{2}(0)=0 \ ,\quad|\alpha|\leq m\ .\]

Given any \(\varphi_{2}\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{2}}\,)\), Taylor's theorem gives

\[\varphi_{2}(x_{2})=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m}{1\over\alpha!}\partial^{\alpha} \varphi_{2}(0)x_{2}^{\alpha}+\psi(x_{2})\ ,\qquad x_{2}\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n_{2}}\ ,\]

---

where \(\psi\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{2}})\) satisfies \(\partial^{\alpha}\psi(0)=0\) for \(|\alpha|\leq m.\) Thus (1.8.18) implies

\[u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})=u\Big{(}\varphi_{1}\otimes\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m }\frac{1}{\alpha!}\partial^{\alpha}\varphi_{2}(0)x_{2}^{\alpha}\Big{)}=\sum_{| \alpha|\leq m}(-1)^{|\alpha|}u_{\alpha}(\varphi_{1})\partial^{\alpha}\varphi_{2 }(0)\]

for \(\varphi_{j}\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{j}})\), where

\[u_{\alpha}(\varphi_{1}):=\frac{(-1)^{|\alpha|}}{\alpha!}u(\varphi_{1}\otimes x _{2}^{\alpha})\ ,\qquad|\alpha|\leq m\ .\]

Now Theorem 1.8.4 entails

\[u=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m}u_{\alpha}\otimes\partial^{\alpha}\delta(x_{2})\]

with \(u_{\alpha}\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{1}},E).\)

Finally, suppose that there are \(\widetilde{m}\in{\mathbb{N}}\) and \(\widetilde{u}_{\alpha}\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{1}},E)\) such that

\[u=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq\widetilde{m}}\widetilde{u}_{\alpha}\otimes\partial^{ \alpha}\delta(x_{2})\ .\]

By replacing \(m\) and \(\widetilde{m}\) by \(\max\{m,\widetilde{m}\},\) we can assume that \(m=\widetilde{m}.\) Then

\[0=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m}(u_{\alpha}-\widetilde{u}_{\alpha})\otimes\partial^{ \alpha}\delta(x_{2})(\varphi_{1}\otimes x^{\beta})=(-1)^{|\beta|}\beta!\,(u_{ \beta}-\widetilde{u}_{\beta})(\varphi_{1})\]

for \(|\beta|\leq m\) and \(\varphi_{1}\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}}^{n_{1}}).\) This proves the asserted uniqueness.

**Topological Tensor Products of Distributions**

Now we consider the special case of tensor products of a scalar and a vector-valued distribution.

**1.8.7 Theorem** _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{{\cal E},{\cal S}\}.\) Then_

\[\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}\mathfrak{F}(X_{2 },E)=\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\ .\]

**Proof** Thanks to Corollary 1.8.2 it suffices to show that \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) induces on \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\) the projective topology.

Given a continuous seminorm \(p\) on \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) belonging to the families (1.1.3) and (1.1.7), respectively, it is easily verified that there exist continuous seminorms \(r\) on \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\) and \(s\) on \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E),\) respectively, such that

\[p(\varphi\otimes\psi)\leq r(\varphi)s(\psi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{1 })\ ,\quad\psi\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\ .\]

---

Hence, given a representation \(\sum\varphi_{j}\otimes\psi_{j}\) of \(z\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\), it follows that

\[p(z)\leq\sum p(\varphi_{j}\otimes\psi_{j})\leq\sum r(\varphi_{j})s(\psi_{j})\ .\]

This implies that \(p(z)\leq r\otimes_{\pi}s(z)\) for \(z\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\). Thus \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) induces on \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\) a topology weaker than the projective topology.

Conversely, let \(r\) and \(s\) be continuous seminorms on \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\) and \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\), respectively, belonging to the respective families (1.1.3) and (1.1.7), and let \(\sum\varphi_{j}\otimes\psi_{j}\) be a representation of \(z\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\). Observe that

\[\sum\langle\varphi^{\prime},\varphi_{j}\rangle\langle\psi^{\prime},\psi_{j} \rangle=\left\langle\varphi^{\prime},\left\langle\psi^{\prime},\sum\varphi_{j} \otimes\psi_{j}\right\rangle\right\rangle\ ,\ \ \ \ \ \varphi^{\prime}\in \mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1})\ ,\ \ \psi^{\prime}\in\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\ .\]

Hence, cf. (1.4.7),

\[r\otimes_{\varepsilon}s(z)=\sup_{\varphi^{\prime}\in\mathfrak{B}^{0}_{\varepsilon }\atop\psi^{\prime}\in\mathfrak{B}^{0}_{\varepsilon}}\Bigl{|}\sum\langle \varphi^{\prime},\varphi_{j}\rangle\langle\psi^{\prime},\psi_{j}\rangle\Bigr{|} =r\Bigl{(}s\Bigl{(}\sum\varphi_{j}\otimes\psi_{j}\Bigr{)}\Bigr{)}\]

by the bipolar theorem, where \(\mathbb{B}_{r}\) is the open \(r\)-unit-ball in \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\) and \(\mathbb{B}_{s}\) is the open \(s\)-unit-ball in \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\). From this we infer the existence of a continuous seminorm \(p\) on \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) such that \(r\otimes_{\varepsilon}s(z)\leq p(z)\) for \(z\in\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\). Thus \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) induces on \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\otimes\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\) a topology that is stronger than the injective tensor product topology. Since \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{1})\) is nuclear, the latter coincides with the projective topology (e.g. [17, Theorem 50.1(f)]).

**1.8.8 Corollary** : _If \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{E},\mathcal{S}\}\) then_

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1})\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}\mathfrak{ F}^{\prime}(X_{2},E^{\prime})=\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)^{\prime}\ .\]

**Proof** From Corollary 1.4.10 and Theorem 1.8.7 we know that

\[\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E^{\prime})=\mathfrak{F}(X_{1}\times X _{2},E)^{\prime}=\bigl{(}\mathfrak{F}_{1}(X_{1})\stackrel{{\sim}} {{\otimes}}\mathfrak{F}(X_{2},E)\bigr{)}^{\prime}\ .\]

Hence the assertion follows from (1.4.16) and by applying Corollary 1.4.10 once more.

It should be remarked that

\[\mathcal{D}(X_{1})\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}\mathcal{D}(X_{2}) \neq\mathcal{D}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\]

as topological vector spaces, although these spaces are equal as vector spaces. Moreover,

\[\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}\mathcal{ D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\neq\bigl{(}\mathcal{D}(X_{1})\stackrel{{\sim}}{{ \otimes}}\mathcal{D}(X_{2})\bigr{)}^{\prime}\]

(cf. [10, chap. I, p. 95]).

---

#### Kernel Theorems

After these preparations we can prove some 'vector-valued kernel theorems':

**1.8.9 Theorem**: _Let \(E\) be a Banach space and let \(X_{j}\) be open in \(\mathbb{R}^{n_{j}}\), \(j=1,2\). Then_

\[\mathcal{E}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E) \cong\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(X_{1}),\mathcal{E}(X_ {2},E)\big{)}\ ,\] \[\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E^{\prime}) \cong\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{E}(X_{1}),\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(X_ {2},E^{\prime})\big{)}\ ,\] \[\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}},E) \cong\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}), \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}},E)\big{)}\ ,\] \[\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}\times\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}},E^ {\prime}) \cong\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}),\mathcal{S}^{ \prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}},E^{\prime})\big{)}\ ,\]

_where \(\cong\) denotes the canonical toplinear isomorphism._

ProofThese assertions are immediate consequences of Theorems 1.4.8 and 1.8.7, and of Corollary 1.8.8.

For completeness we also include a proof of the 'classical' Schwartz kernel theorem for scalar distributions. To do this we rely on the following functional-analytical result:

**1.8.10 Lemma**: _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}\}\). Let \((u_{\alpha})\) be a net in \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes_{\pi}\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{2})\). Then \((u_{\alpha})\) converges to zero iff \(\langle u_{\alpha},\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2}\rangle\to 0\), uniformly with respect to \(\varphi_{j}\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{j})\), \(j=1,2\)._

ProofLet \(F\) and \(G\) be complete LCSs such that \(F\) is nuclear. Then it follows from [23, Corollaries 1 and 2 to Theorem IV.9.4], for example, that a net \((v_{\alpha})\) converges in \(F\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}G\) towards zero iff \(v_{\alpha}(f^{\prime}\otimes g^{\prime})\to 0\), uniformly with respect to \(f^{\prime}\) and \(g^{\prime}\) in equicontinuous subsets of \(F^{\prime}_{w^{\star}}\) and \(G^{\prime}_{w^{\star}}\), respectively. Put \(F:=\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1})\) and \(G:=\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{2})\). Let \(B_{j}\) be a bounded subset of \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{j})\). Then \(B_{j}\) is weakly bounded, hence bounded in \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{j})_{w^{\star}}=\mathcal{L}_{s}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X _{j}),\mathbb{C}\big{)}\), by the reflexivity of \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{j})\). Thus the uniform boundedness principle implies that \(B_{j}\) is equicontinuous in \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{j})_{w^{\star}}\). Thus if \((u_{\alpha})\) is a net in \(\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{1})\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}} \mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{2})\) converging towards zero, it follows from \(\big{[}\mathfrak{F}^{\prime}(X_{j})\big{]}^{\prime}_{w^{\star}}=\mathfrak{F}( X_{j})_{w^{\star}}\) that \(\langle u_{\alpha},\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2}\rangle\to 0\), uniformly with respect to \(\varphi_{j}\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathfrak{F}(X_{j})\), \(j=1,2\), as asserted.

**1.8.11 Theorem**: \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\cong\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}(X_ {1}),\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\big{)}\) _by means of the canonical toplinear isomorphism._

ProofIt is easily verified that the bilinear map

\[\mathcal{D}(X_{1})\times\mathcal{D}(X_{2})\to\mathcal{D}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\ ,\quad(\varphi_{1},\varphi_{2})\mapsto\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2}\]

is continuous, hence hypocontinuous. Given \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\) and \(\varphi_{1}\in\mathcal{D}(X_{1})\), put

\[\varphi_{1}\cdot u(\varphi_{2}):=u(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})\ ,\qquad \varphi_{2}\in\mathcal{D}(X_{2})\ ,\]

---

(using obvious identifications). It follows that \(\varphi_{1}\cdot u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\) and

\[T_{u}:=(\varphi_{1}\mapsto\varphi_{1}\cdot u)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X_{1}),{ \cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\bigr{)}\ .\]

Let \((u_{\alpha})\) be a net in \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\) converging towards zero. Then \(\langle u_{\alpha},\varphi\rangle\to 0\), uniformly with respect to \(\varphi\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal D}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\). Consequently, \(T_{u_{\alpha}}\varphi_{1}=\varphi_{1}\cdot u_{\alpha}\to 0\) in \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\), uniformly with respect to \(\varphi_{1}\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal D}(X_{1})\). This shows that

\[T:=(u\mapsto T_{u})\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2}),{ \cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X_{1}),{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\bigr{)}\bigr{)}\ .\]

By Theorem 1.4.8 we know that

\[{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\mathrel{\mathop{\otimes}\limits^{\sim}}{\cal D}^{ \prime}(X_{2})\cong{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X_{1}),{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2}) \bigr{)}\ .\]

If \(u=u_{1}\otimes u_{2}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\), we see that \(T_{u}\varphi_{1}=\langle u_{1},\varphi_{1}\rangle u_{2}\) for \(\varphi_{1}\in{\cal D}(X_{1})\). This shows that \(T\,|\,{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\) equals the canonical injection (1.4.5) of the tensor product \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\) in \({\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal D}(X_{1}),{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\bigr{)}\). Thus we infer from (1.8.19) that \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\) induces on \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\) a topology that is stronger than the projective topology.

Conversely, let \((u_{\alpha})\) be a net in \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes_{\pi}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\) converging towards zero. Then \(\langle u_{\alpha},\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2}\rangle\to 0\), uniformly with respect to \(\varphi_{j}\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal D}(X_{j})\), \(j=1,2\), thanks to Lemma 1.8.10. Hence, given any \(\psi_{j}\in{\cal D}(X_{j}),\ j=1,2\), it follows that

\[\bigl{\langle}(\psi_{1}\otimes\psi_{2})u_{\alpha},\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2 }\bigr{\rangle}_{{\cal E}}=\langle u_{\alpha},\psi_{1}\varphi_{1}\otimes\psi_{ 2}\varphi_{2}\rangle_{{\cal D}}\to 0\ ,\]

uniformly with respect to \(\varphi_{j}\) in bounded subsets of \({\cal E}(X_{j}),\ j=1,2\). Now we infer from Lemma 1.8.10 that \((\psi_{1}\otimes\psi_{2})u_{\alpha}\to 0\) in \({\cal E}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes{\cal E}^{\prime}(X_{2})\). Theorem 1.8.9 implies \((\psi_{1}\otimes\psi_{2})u_{\alpha}\to 0\) in \({\cal E}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\) for each pair \((\psi_{1},\psi_{2})\in{\cal D}(X_{1})\times{\cal D}(X_{2})\). This entails \(u_{\alpha}\,|\,{\cal D}_{K}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\to 0\) for \(K\subset\subset X_{1}\times X_{2}\). Consequently, \(u_{\alpha}\to 0\) in \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\), which shows that the projective topology is stronger than the topology induced by \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\) on \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\).

We know from Corollary 1.8.2 that \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\otimes{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\) is dense in \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\). Hence it follows that

\[{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1})\mathrel{\mathop{\otimes}\limits^{\sim}}{\cal D}^{ \prime}(X_{2})={\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\ ,\]

which, together with (1.8.20), proves the assertion.

**1.8.12 Remarks** (a): It may be useful to reinterprete the Kernel Theorems 1.8.9 and 1.8.11. Suppose, for example, that \(k\in{\cal E}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) and define \(K\) by the relation

\[(K\varphi_{1})(\varphi_{2})=k(\varphi_{1}\otimes\varphi_{2})\ ,\qquad\varphi_{j} \in{\cal E}(X_{j})\ ,\quad j=1,2\ .\]

Then Theorem 1.8.9 guarantees that

\[K\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal E}(X_{1}),{\cal E}^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\bigr{)}\ .\]

---

Conversely, for any \(K\) satisfying (1.8.23) there exists a unique \(k\in{\cal E}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) such that (1.8.22) is true. Moreover, the map

\[{\cal E}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\to{\cal L}\big{(}{\cal E}(X_{1}),{\cal E} ^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\big{)}\ ,\quad k\mapsto K\] (1.8.24)

is a toplinear isomorphism. The distribution \(k\) is said to be the kernel of the map \(K\), and \(K\) is associated to the kernel \(k\). In _symbolic notation_ the isomorphism (1.8.24) is written as

\[K\varphi_{1}=\int_{X_{1}}k(x_{1},\cdot)\varphi_{1}(x_{1})\,dx_{1}\ ,\qquad \varphi_{1}\in{\cal E}(X_{1})\ .\]

In this case (1.8.22) takes the suggestive form

\[\int_{X_{2}}(K\varphi_{1})(x_{2})\varphi_{2}(x_{2})\,dx_{2}=\int_{X_{1}\times X _{2}}k(x_{1},x_{2})\varphi_{1}(x_{1})\varphi_{2}(x_{2})\,d(x_{1},x_{2})\ .\]

The kernel \(k\in{\cal E}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) is said to be regularizing if its associated map \(K\) can be extended from \({\cal D}(X_{1})\) to a continuous linear map of \({\cal E}^{\prime}(X_{1})\) into \({\cal E}(X_{2},E)\). Thanks to Theorem 1.8.9 this is the case iff \(k\in{\cal E}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\). Similar definitions and conventions apply to tempered distributions and to the classical case of the Schwartz Kernel Theorem (1.8.11).
**(b)**: It is easily verified that the first part of the proof of Theorem 1.8.11 remains valid if we replace \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2})\) and \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2})\) by \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\) and \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\), respectively. From this we infer that

\[{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\hookrightarrow{\cal L}\big{(}{\cal D}(X _{1}),{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\big{)}\] (1.8.25)

by means of obvious identifications. This signifies that each kernel distribution \(k\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{1}\times X_{2},E)\) induces a unique continuous linear operator \(K\) from \({\cal D}(X_{1})\) to \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\), and that the map \(k\mapsto K\) is continuous and injective. But we do not know whether (1.8.25) is surjective. However,

\[{\cal L}\big{(}{\cal D}(X_{1}),{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\big{)}\cong{\cal D}^ {\prime}(X_{1})\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2 })\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E\ ,\]

where \(\cong\) denotes the canonical toplinear isomorphism.
**Proof** From Lemma 1.4.7 we infer that \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\) is complete. Hence Theorem 1.4.8 guarantees that

\[{\cal L}\big{(}{\cal D}(X_{1}),{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2},E)\big{)}\cong{\cal D}^ {\prime}(X_{1})\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}{\cal D}^{\prime}(X_{2 },E)\ .\]

Now the assertion follows from Theorem 1.4.9 and the natural associativity of topological tensor products (cf. [10, SS I.1.4]).

### Convolutions of Vector-Valued Distributions

In Subsection 1.2 we have already defined convolutions of a vector-valued and a scalar distribution. In this subsection we extend these definitions to the case of two vector-valued distributions. In addition, we weaken the support restrictions.

#### The Basic Theorem

**1.9.1 Theorem**: _Suppose that either \(u_{1}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in{\cal E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\), or \(u_{1}\in{\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in{\cal S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\). Then there exists a unique distribution in \({\cal D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\) or \({\cal O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\), respectively, the_ **convolution of \(u_{1}\) and \(u_{2}\) with respect to multiplication** (1.5.20), denoted by \(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\), such that_

\[(v_{1}\otimes e_{1})*_{\bullet}(v_{2}\otimes e_{2})=(v_{1}*v_{2})\otimes(e_{1} \bullet e_{2})\] (1.9.1)

_for \(v_{1},v_{2}\in{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), \(e_{j}\in E_{j}\), and \(j=1,2\), and such that the 'convolution maps' \((u_{1},u_{2})\mapsto u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\) are bilinear and hypocontinuous_:

\[{\cal D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}, E_{2})\to{\cal D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\] (1.9.2)

_and_

\[{\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\to{ \cal O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ ,\] (1.9.3)

_respectively. In addition, the convolution maps restrict to hypocontinuous bilinear maps_:

\[{\cal E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal E}^{\prime}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\to {\cal E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ ,\] (1.9.4) \[{\cal E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^ {n},E_{2})\to {\cal E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ ,\] (1.9.5) \[{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^ {n},E_{2})\to {\cal E}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ ,\] (1.9.6) \[{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^ {n},E_{2})\to {\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ ,\] (1.9.7) \[{\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times\ {\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\to {\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ .\] (1.9.8)

ProofLet \((\mathfrak{F}_{1},\mathfrak{F}_{2};\mathfrak{F}_{0})\) be either of the triplets \(({\cal D}^{\prime},{\cal E}^{\prime};{\cal D}^{\prime})\), \(({\cal S},{\cal S}^{\prime};{\cal O}_{M})\), \(({\cal E}^{\prime},{\cal E}^{\prime};{\cal E}^{\prime})\), \(({\cal E},{\cal E}^{\prime};{\cal E})\), \(({\cal D},{\cal D}^{\prime};{\cal E})\), \(({\cal D},{\cal E}^{\prime};{\cal D})\), or \(({\cal S},{\cal S};{\cal S})\), and put \(F_{j}:=\mathfrak{F}_{j}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), \(j=0,1,2\). Then the \(F_{j}\) are reflexive, complete, nuclear, and conuclear by Theorems 1.1.2 and 1.4.3. Moreover, \(F_{j}\stackrel{{\sim}}{{\otimes}}E_{j}=\mathfrak{F}_{j}(\mathbb{R} ^{n},E_{j})\) by Theorem 1.4.9. Define the maps (1.5.14) and (1.5.15) by \(f_{1}\odot f_{2}:=f_{1}*f_{2}\) and \(f_{1}\otimes v:=f_{1}*v\), respectively. From Propositions 1.2.1, 1.2.3, and 1.2.7 we know that they are well-defined and that (1.5.15) is hypocontinuous. Definition (1.2.1) of convolution immediately implies that condition (1.5.16) is satisfied. Hence Theorem 1.5.3 guarantees the existence of a unique hypocontinuous bilinear map

\[\mathfrak{F}_{1}(X,E_{1})\times\mathfrak{F}_{2}(X,E_{2})\to\mathfrak{F}_{0}(X, E_{0})\ ,\quad(u_{1},u_{2})\mapsto u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\] (1.9.9)

satisfying (1.9.1) for \(u_{j}\in\mathfrak{F}_{j}(X)\) and \(e_{j}\in E_{j}\), \(j=1,2\). By Theorem 1.3.6 the linear subspace \(\big{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{1}\big{)}\times\big{(}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{2}\big{)}\) is dense in \(\mathfrak{F}_{1}(X,E_{1})\times\mathfrak{F}_{2}(X,E_{2})\).

---

Hence the map (1.9.9) is determined by its restriction to this subspace. This proves the theorem.

**1.9.2 Remarks**:
**(a)**: It should be observed that Theorem 1.9.1 is 'symmetric in \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\)', that is, the roles of \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) can be interchanged. This fact will be used throughout, usually without further mention.
**(b)**: Suppose that either \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{j})\), \(j=1,2\), and that \(u_{1}\) or \(u_{2}\) has compact support, or \(u_{1}\in{\cal S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in{\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\). Then

\[u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi)=u_{1}*_{\bullet}(u_{2}*\dot{\varphi})(0)=\big{<} u_{1}\bullet(\check{u}_{2}*\varphi)\big{>}_{\cal D}\] (1.9.10)

for \(\varphi\in{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\).

**Proof** We can assume that \(u_{2}\in{\cal E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\) in the first case. Then by Theorems 1.7.2 and 1.9.1 each one of the three expressions in (1.9.10) defines a separately continuous trilinear map

\[{\cal D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n}, E_{2})\times{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\to E_{0}\]

in the first case, and

\[{\cal S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2}) \times{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\to E_{0}\]

in the second one. Suppose that \(u_{j}=v_{j}\otimes e_{j}\in{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\times E_{j}\), \(j=1,2\). Then we deduce from (1.9.1), (1.2.11), and (1.2.13) that

\[u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi) =(v_{1}\otimes e_{1})*_{\bullet}(v_{2}\otimes e_{2})(\varphi)=v_{ 1}*v_{2}(\varphi)(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\] \[=v_{1}*(v_{2}*\dot{\varphi})(0)(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})=\big{[}v_{1}* (v_{2}*\dot{\varphi})\big{]}\otimes(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})(0)\] \[=u_{1}*_{\bullet}(u_{2}*\dot{\varphi})(0)\ .\]

Moreover, by these calculations, (1.2.11), Remark 1.2.4(c), and (1.7.4),

\[u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi) =v_{1}*(v_{2}*\dot{\varphi})(0)(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})=\big{<}v_{1}, (v_{2}*\dot{\varphi})\char 1111\big{>}_{\cal D}(e_{1}\bullet e_{2})\] \[=\big{<}v_{1},\check{v}_{2}*\varphi)_{\cal D}(e_{1}\bullet e_{2}) =\big{<}(v_{1}\otimes e_{1})\bullet\big{[}(\check{v}_{2}*\varphi)\otimes e_{2 }\big{]}\big{>}_{\cal D}\] \[=\big{<}u_{1}\bullet(\check{u}_{2}*\varphi)\big{>}_{\cal D}\ .\]

Thus all three terms in (1.9.10) agree on the dense linear subspace

\[\big{(}{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\otimes E_{1}\big{)}\times\big{(}{\cal D}( \mathbb{R}^{n})\otimes E_{2}\big{)}\times{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ ,\]

and so everywhere.

### \(L_{p}\)-Functions with Compact Supports

Given \(K\subset\subset X\), we put

\[L_{p,K}(X,E):=\big{\{}u\in L_{p}(X,E)\ ;\ \operatorname{supp}(u)\subset\overline{K} \,\big{\}}\ ,\qquad 1\leq p\leq\infty\ .\]

---

Then \(L_{p,K}(X,E)\) is a closed linear subspace of the Banach space \(L_{p}(X,E)\), hence a Banach space as well. Moreover,

\[\bigcup_{K\subset\subset X}L_{p,K}(X,E)=\big{\{}\,u\in L_{p}(X,E)\ ;\ \text{supp}(u)\subset\subset X\,\big{\}}\ .\]

Thus, recalling (1.1.5) and (1.1.6),

\[L_{p,c}(X,E):=\varinjlim_{K\subset\subset X}L_{p,K}(X,E)\ ,\qquad 1\leq p\leq\infty\ ,\] (1.9.11)

is a well-defined \(LF\)-space, the space of \(E\)-**valued \(L_{p}\)-functions with compact supports**. It is obvious that

\[L_{p,c}(X,E)\hookrightarrow L_{p}(X,E)\hookrightarrow L_{1,\text{loc}}(X,E) \hookrightarrow{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E)\] (1.9.12)

for \(1\leq p\leq\infty\), and it is not difficult to see that

\[{\cal D}(X,E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}L_{p,c}(X,E)\ , \qquad 1\leq p<\infty\ ,\] (1.9.13)

by using Theorem 1.3.6(viii) with \(k=0\).

**Convolutions of Regular Distributions**

Our next proposition shows that the convolution product of regular distributions is again a regular distribution, if defined.

**1.9.3 Proposition** _Suppose that \(u_{1}\in L_{1,\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in L_{1,c}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\). Then \(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\in L_{1,\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\) and_

\[u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}u_{1}(x-y)\bullet u_{2}(y)\,dy= \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}u_{1}(y)\bullet u_{2}(x-y)\,dy\] (1.9.14)

_for a.a. \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\). Moreover, the convolution map \((u_{1},u_{2})\mapsto u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\) is bilinear and continuous_:

\[L_{1,\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times L_{1,c}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2}) \to L_{1,\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ .\] (1.9.15)

**Proof** We deduce from Theorem 1.9.1 and (1.9.12) that the convolution map is separately continuous from \(L_{1,\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times L_{1,c}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\) into \({\cal D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\).

Suppose that \(K,K_{2}\subset\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}\). Then, letting \(K_{1}:=K-K_{2}\subset\subset\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}\), Tonelli's theorem implies

\[\int_{K}\Bigl{|}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}u_{1}(x-y)\bullet u_{2}(y) \,dy\Bigr{|}\,dx \leq\int_{K}\int_{K_{2}}|u_{1}(x-y)|\,|u_{2}(y)|\,dy\,dx\] \[\leq\|u_{1}\|_{1,K_{1}}\,\|u_{2}\|_{1,K_{2}}\]

---

for \(u_{j}\in L_{1,\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{j})\) with \(\mathrm{supp}(u_{2})\subset K_{2}\). From this we deduce that

\[(u_{1},u_{2})\mapsto\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}u_{1}(\cdot-y)\bullet u_{2}(y)\,dy\]

is a bilinear and continuous map

\[L_{1,\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times L_{1,c}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E_{2}) \to L_{1,\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\hookrightarrow\mathcal{D}^{\prime }(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E_{0})\ .\]

By [1, (III.4.2.17)] and (1.9.1) we infer that both sides of (1.9.14) coincide on the linear subspace \(L_{1,\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times\bigl{(}\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{ n})\otimes E_{2}\bigr{)}\), which is dense by (1.9.13). Thus the assertion follows.

#### Tensor Products and Convolutions

Given the hypotheses of Proposition 1.9.3, we deduce from (1.9.14) by Fubini's theorem, a change of variables, and Remark 1.8.5(d) that

\[u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi) =\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\varphi(x)u_{1}(x-y) \bullet u_{2}(y)\,dy\,dx\] \[=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}}\varphi(x+y)u_{1}(x) \bullet u_{2}(y)\,d(x,y)=u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}\bigl{(}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2 })\bigr{)}\]

for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), where in the last term we use our symbolic notation, meaning that \(u_{j}\) acts on the function following it as a variable of \(x_{j}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\). The next theorem shows that this formula holds in general.

1.9.4 Theorem: _Suppose that one of the distributions \(u_{j}\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{j})\), \(j=1,2\), has compact support. Then_

\[u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi)=u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}\bigl{(}\varphi(x _{1}+x_{2})\bigr{)}\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ .\]

ProofBy Remark 1.9.2(b) and Fubini's rule for tensor products

\[u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi) =\bigl{\langle}u_{1}\bullet(\tilde{u}_{2}\ast\varphi)\bigr{\rangle} _{\mathcal{D}}=\bigl{\langle}u_{1}\bullet\tilde{u}_{2}(\tau_{x_{1}}\varphi) \bigr{\rangle}_{\mathcal{D}}=\bigl{\langle}u_{1}\bullet u_{2}\bigl{(}\tau_{x_{ 1}}\varphi(-x_{2})\bigr{)}\bigr{\rangle}_{\mathcal{D}}\] \[=\bigl{\langle}u_{1}\bullet u_{2}\bigl{(}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2}) \bigr{)}\bigr{\rangle}=u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2}\bigl{(}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2}) \bigr{)}\]

for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\).

Theorem 1.9.4 enables us to define convolutions in certain cases where neither \(u_{1}\) nor \(u_{2}\) has compact support. For this we recall that a mapping between metric spaces is **proper**, if preimages of compact sets are compact. Given nonempty closed subsets \(A_{1},\ldots,A_{m}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), we say \((A_{1},\ldots,A_{m})\) satisfies **condition** (\(\Sigma\)) if the map

\[A_{1}\times\cdots\times A_{m}\to\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\quad(x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}) \mapsto x_{1}+\cdots+x_{m}\]

is proper.

---

**1.9.5 Remarks** (a): A proper continuous mapping is **closed**, that is, it maps closed sets onto closed sets. Hence if \((A_{1},\ldots,A_{m})\) satisfies condition \((\Sigma)\) then the set \(A_{1}+\cdots+A_{m}\) is closed in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\).
**(b)**: If \(A_{1},\ldots,A_{m}\) are closed in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and all but one are compact, then \((A_{1},\ldots,A_{m})\) satisfies condition \((\Sigma)\).
**(c)**: Let \(\Gamma\) be a closed convex proper cone in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\). (A cone \(\Gamma\) is proper if it does not contain a full line, that is, if \(\Gamma\cap(-\Gamma)=\{0\}\).) Then the \(m\)-tuple \((\Gamma,\ldots,\Gamma)\) satisfies condition \((\Sigma)\). If \(\mathsf{H}:=\big{\{}\,y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ;\ \langle\eta,y\rangle\geq 0\, \big{\}}\) is a closed half-space with interior normal \(\eta\) lying in the interior of the dual cone \(\Gamma^{\prime}:=\big{\{}\,\xi\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ;\ \langle\xi,x\rangle\geq 0 ,\ x\in\Gamma\,\big{\}}\), then the \(m\)-tuple \((\Gamma,\ldots,\Gamma,\mathsf{H})\) satisfies condition \((\Sigma)\). Note that \(\operatorname{int}(\Gamma^{\prime})\neq\emptyset\).

**Proof** First we assume that \(m=2\). Thus let \(\big{\{}(x_{j},y_{j})\big{\}}\) be a sequence in \(\Gamma\times\mathsf{B}\), where \(\mathsf{B}\in\{\Gamma,\mathsf{H}\}\), such that \(x_{j}+y_{j}\to z\) in \(\mathbb{R}^{m}\). Then, by the local compactness and the closedness of \(\Gamma\) and \(\mathsf{B}\), it suffices to prove that \((x_{j})\) and \((y_{j})\) are bounded sequences. If this is not the case, clearly both sequences have to be unbounded. Thus, by passing to a suitable subsequence we can assume that \(|x_{j}|\to\infty\) and \(x_{j}/|x_{j}|\to x\in\hat{\mathsf{I}}\). Hence \(y_{j}/|x_{j}|\to-x\in\hat{\mathsf{B}}\). If \(\mathsf{B}=\Gamma\), this is impossible since \(\Gamma\) is proper. If \(\mathsf{B}=\mathsf{H}\), it follows that \(0<\langle\eta,x\rangle\) since \(\eta\in\operatorname{int}(\Gamma^{\prime})\) and \(x\in\hat{\mathsf{I}}\), and \(\langle\eta,x\rangle\leq 0\) since \(-x\in\mathsf{H}\), which is again a contradiction. The general case is derived from an obvious induction argument.

In the following, the distributions \(u_{1},\ldots,u_{m}\) are said to have **convolutive supports** or to **satisfy condition**\((\Sigma)\) if their supports satisfy condition \((\Sigma)\).

Let \(u_{j}\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{j}),\ j=1,2\), satisfy condition \((\Sigma)\), and let \(X\) be a bounded open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\). Then there exists \(\rho:=\rho_{X}>0\) such that

\[\big{(}x_{j}\in\operatorname{supp}(u_{j})\ ,\ x_{1}+x_{2}\in X\big{)}\quad \Longrightarrow\quad\big{(}x_{j}\in\rho\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\ j=1,2\big{)}\ .\] (1.9.16)

Thus, given

\[\psi_{j}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\quad\text{with}\quad\psi_{j}\,|\, \rho\mathbb{B}^{n}\,=1\ ,\qquad j=1,2\ ,\] (1.9.17)

convolution \((\psi_{1}u_{1})\ast_{\bullet}(\psi_{2}u_{2})\) is well-defined, since \(\psi_{j}u_{j}\in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{j})\). Moreover, for \(\chi_{j}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) with \(\chi_{j}\,|\rho\mathbb{B}^{n}=1\) it follows from Remarks 1.8.5(a) and (e), the fact that \(\psi_{j}-\chi_{j}\) vanish on \(\rho\mathbb{B}^{n}\), and from (1.9.16) that, given \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}\),

\[\big{[}(\psi_{1}u_{1})\ast_{\bullet}(\psi_{2}u_{2})-(\chi_{1}u_{1 })\ast_{\bullet}(\chi_{2}u_{2})\big{]}(\varphi)\] \[\quad=\big{[}(\psi_{1}u_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}(\psi_{2}u_{2})-( \chi_{1}u_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}(\chi_{2}u_{2})\big{]}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2} )\big{)}\] \[\quad=\big{[}(\psi_{1}-\chi_{1})u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}(\psi_{2}u_ {2})+(\chi_{1}u_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}(\psi_{2}-\chi_{2})u_{2}\big{]}\big{(} \varphi(x_{1}+x_{2})\big{)}\] \[\quad=\Big{\{}\big{[}(\psi_{1}-\chi_{1})\otimes\psi_{2}\big{]}(u_ {1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2})+\big{[}\chi_{1}\otimes(\psi_{2}-\chi_{2})\big{]}(u_ {1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2})\Big{\}}\big{(}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2})\big{)}\] \[\quad=(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2})\Big{\{}\big{[}(\psi_{1}-\chi _{1})(x_{1})\psi_{2}(x_{2})+\chi_{1}(x_{1})(\psi_{2}-\chi_{2})(x_{2})\big{]} \varphi(x_{1}+x_{2})\Big{\}}=0\ .\]

---

This shows that \((\psi_{1}u_{1})*_{\bullet}(\psi_{2}u_{2})\) defines a distribution in \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E_{0})\), independently of the choice of the \(\psi_{j}\) satisfying (1.9.17). From this and the fact that a distribution is determined by its values on the open subsets of \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) (e.g., [Hor83, Theorem 2.2.4] and note that the proof carries over to the \(E\)-valued case) we see that

\[\left.\begin{array}{l}\mbox{given}\;\;u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^ {n},E_{j}),\;\;j=1,2,\;\mbox{having convolutive supports,}\\ \mbox{there exists a unique distribution $u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^ {n},E_{0})$, the $\mbox{\bf convolution of $u_{1}$ and $u_{2}$ with respect to multiplication (\ref{eq:1.5.20})}$,}\\ \mbox{satisfying}\\ \mbox{where $\psi_{j}$ satisfies (\ref{eq:1.9.17}) for $j=1,2$.}\end{array}\right\}\] (1.9.18)

#### Basic Properties

In the following remarks we collect some of the most important properties of convolutions.

**1.9.6 Remarks**: Unless explicit restrictions are given, we suppose that either \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{j})\) for \(j=1,2\), with convolutive supports, or that \(u_{1}\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2})\).
**(a)**: It is an obvious consequence of (1.9.18) and Remark 1.9.2(b) that

\[u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi)=u_{1}*(u_{2}*\breve{\varphi})(0)=\big{\langle}u _{1}\bullet(\breve{u}_{2}*\varphi)\big{\rangle}_{\cal D}\]

for \(\varphi\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\).
**(b)**: If \(u_{j}\in L_{1,{\rm loc}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{j})\) satisfy condition \((\Sigma)\) then \(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\in L_{1,{\rm loc}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{0})\) and

\[u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(x)=\int_{{\mathbb{R}}^{n}}\!\!u_{1}(x-y)\bullet u_{2}(y) \,dy=\int_{{\mathbb{R}}^{n}}\!\!u_{1}(y)\bullet u_{2}(x-y)\,dy\ ,\quad\mbox{ a.a. $x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}$ }\ .\]

ProofThanks to (1.9.18) we can assume that \(u_{j}\) has compact support for \(j=1,2\). Then the assertion follows from Proposition 1.9.3.
**(c)**: _Associativity_ Let the associativity hypotheses of Remark 1.6.5(e) be satisfied and suppose that either \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{j})\), \(j=1,2,3\), have convolutive supports, or \(u_{1}\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{k}\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{k})\), \(k=2,3\). Then

\[u_{1}*_{\bullet}(u_{2}*_{\bullet}u_{3})=(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2})*_{\bullet}u_{3 }\ .\] (1.9.19)

ProofIf condition \((\Sigma)\) is satisfied,2 it suffices, by (1.9.18), to prove the assertion for \(u_{j}\in{\cal E}^{\prime}(X,E_{j})\), \(j=1,2,3\). Then Theorem 1.9.1 implies that both sides of

---

(1.9.19) define separately continuous trilinear maps

\[{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}, E_{2})\times{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{3})\to{\cal E}^{\prime}({ \mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{0})\]

if condition \((\Sigma)\) is satisfied, and

\[{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\times{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2} )\times{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{3})\to{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{0})\]

otherwise. Thanks to (1.9.1) and (1.2.13) they coincide on the dense linear subspace \(\prod_{j=1}^{3}{\cal D}(X)\otimes E_{j}\). Thus they are equal.

**(d)**_Commutativity_ Suppose that \(E_{1}=E_{2}=:E\) and multiplication (1.5.20) is symmetric. Then \(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}=u_{2}*_{\bullet}u_{1}\).

**Proof** By (1.9.18) we can assume that \(u_{j}\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) if condition \((\Sigma)\) is satisfied. Thus, by Theorem 1.9.1 and the density of \({\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) in \({\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and in \({\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and \({\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), respectively, we can assume that \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\). Now the assertion follows from (b).

**(e)**_Distributivity_ Let the distributivity hypotheses of Remark 1.8.5(e) be satisfied and suppose that \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{j})\) as well as \(v_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{j+2})\), \(j=1,2\), have convolutive supports. Then

\[(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2})\otimes_{\bullet}(v_{1}*_{\bullet}v_{2})=(u_{1}\otimes_ {\bullet}v_{1})*_{\bullet}(u_{2}\otimes_{\bullet}v_{2})\ .\] (1.9.20)

**Proof** First we show that \(u_{j}\otimes_{\bullet}v_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{ \mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{j+5})\) satisfy condition \((\Sigma)\). By Remark 1.8.5(a)

\[{\rm supp}(u_{j}\otimes_{\bullet}v_{j})\subset{\rm supp}(u_{j})\times{\rm supp }(v_{j})\ ,\qquad j=1,2\ .\] (1.9.21)

Let \(X\subset{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) be bounded and open. Then there exists \(\rho>0\) such that \(x_{j}\in{\rm supp}(u_{j})\) and \(y_{j}\in{\rm supp}(v_{j})\) with \(x_{1}+x_{2}\) and \(y_{1}+y_{2}\) belonging to \(X\) imply \(x_{j},y_{j}\in\rho{\mathbb{B}}^{n}\). Thus, if \((x_{1},y_{1})+(x_{2},y_{2})\in X\times X\), it follows from (1.9.21) that

\[(x_{j},y_{j})\in\rho{\mathbb{B}}^{n}\times\rho{\mathbb{B}}^{n}\subset\rho_{1}{ \mathbb{B}}^{2n}\ ,\qquad j=1,2\ ,\]

for some \(\rho_{1}>0\). Since every bounded open subset of \({\mathbb{R}}^{2n}\) is contained in a product set \(X\times X\), we see that \(u_{j}\otimes v_{j}\) satisfy condition \((\Sigma)\). Hence both sides of (1.9.20) are well-defined.

Given \(\psi_{j},\psi_{j+2}\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\), it follows from Remark 1.8.5(e) that

\[(\psi_{j}u_{j})\otimes_{\bullet}v_{j}(\psi_{j+2}v_{j})=(\psi_{j}\otimes\psi_{j +2})(u_{j}\otimes_{\bullet}v_{j})\ ,\qquad j=1,2\ .\]

Using this and (1.9.18) it is easily seen that it suffices to prove the assertion for \(u_{j}\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E_{j})\) and \(v_{j}\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E_{j+2})\), \(j=1,2\). Now Theorems 1.8.4 and 1.9.1 together with a density argument show that we can assume that \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E_{j})\)

---

and \(v_{j}\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{j+2})\). Thus, by (b) and Remark 1.8.5(d), the left-hand side of (1.9.20) equals

\[\int_{{\mathbb{R}}^{n}}u_{1}(x_{1}-y_{1})\bullet u_{2}(y_{1})\,dy_{1}\bullet\int _{{\mathbb{R}}^{n}}v_{1}(x_{2}-y_{2})\bullet v_{2}(y_{2})\,dy_{2}\ ,\quad(x_{1},x_{2}) \in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ .\]

By Fubini's theorem and (1.8.12) this product takes the form

\[\int_{{\mathbb{R}}^{2n}}\bigl{(}u_{1}(x_{1}-y_{1})\bullet v_{1}(x_{2}-y_{2}) \bigr{)}\bullet\bigl{(}u_{2}(y_{1})\bullet v_{2}(y_{2})\bigr{)}\,d(y_{1},y_{2 })\ ,\]

which is the right-hand side of (1.9.20).

**(f)**: _Support Theorem_ Suppose that \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{j}),\ \ j=1,2\), have convolutive supports. Then \(\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2})\subset\mathop{\rm supp} \nolimits(u_{1})+\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(u_{2})\).

**Proof** From Remark 1.9.5(a) we know that \(C:=\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(u_{1})+\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(u_{2})\) is closed in \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\). Let \(\varphi\in{\cal D}(C^{c})\). Then the support of the function \((x_{1},x_{2})\mapsto\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2})\) does not meet \(\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(u_{1})\times\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(u_{2})\), hence not \(\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}u_{2})\) by Remark 1.8.5(a). Thus \((\psi_{1}u_{1})*_{\bullet}(\psi_{2}u_{2})(\varphi)=(\psi_{1}u_{1})\otimes_{ \bullet}(\psi_{2}u_{2})\bigl{(}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2})\bigr{)}=0\) for all \(\psi_{j}\in{\cal D}(X)\), \(j=1,2\). Consequently, (1.9.18) implies \(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(\varphi)=0\), that is, the assertion.

**(g)**: \(\partial^{\alpha+\beta}(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2})=\partial^{\alpha}u_{1}*_{ \bullet}\partial^{\beta}u_{2},\ \ \alpha,\beta\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\).

**Proof** First suppose that \(u_{1}\) and \(u_{2}\) satisfy condition (\(\Sigma\)). Since

\[\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(\partial^{\gamma}u)\subset\mathop{\rm supp} \nolimits(u)\ ,\qquad u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ ,\quad\gamma\in{ \mathbb{N}}^{n}\ ,\]

it follows that \(\partial^{\alpha}u_{1}\) and \(\partial^{\beta}u_{2}\) satisfy condition (\(\Sigma\)). Hence \(\partial^{\alpha}u_{1}*_{\bullet}\partial^{\beta}u_{2}\) is well-defined. Given \(\varphi\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\),

\[\partial^{\alpha+\beta}(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2})(\varphi)=(-1)^{|\alpha|+|\beta |}(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2})(\partial^{\alpha+\beta}\varphi)\ .\]

Let \(X\) be a bounded open subset of \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) containing \(\mathop{\rm supp}\nolimits(\varphi)\) and choose \(\psi_{j}\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) with \(\psi_{j}\,|\,\rho_{X}{\mathbb{R}}^{n}=1\). Then

\[(-1)^{|\alpha|+|\beta|}(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2})(\partial^{\alpha+ \beta}\varphi) =(-1)^{|\alpha|+|\beta|}(\psi_{1}u_{1})*_{\bullet}(\psi_{2}u_{2}) (\partial^{\alpha+\beta}\varphi)\] \[=(-1)^{|\alpha|+|\beta|}(\psi_{1}u_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}(\psi_{2} u_{2})\bigl{(}\partial^{\alpha+\beta}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2})\bigr{)}\] \[=\partial^{\alpha}(\psi_{1}u_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}\partial^{\beta }(\psi_{2}u_{2})\bigl{(}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2})\bigr{)}\] \[=(\psi_{1}\partial^{\alpha}u_{1})\otimes_{\bullet}(\psi_{2} \partial^{\beta}u_{2})\bigl{(}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2})\bigr{)}\] \[=(\psi_{1}\partial^{\alpha}u_{1})*_{\bullet}(\psi_{2}\partial^{ \beta}u_{2})(\varphi)\] \[=\partial^{\alpha}u_{1}*_{\bullet}\partial^{\beta}u_{2}(\varphi)\ ,\]

thanks to Remark 1.8.5(b), Leibniz' rule, and the properties of \(\psi_{j}\).

If \(u_{1}\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2})\), we can restrict ourselves as usual to the case \(u_{j}\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\otimes E_{j}\). Then the assertion follows from Remark 1.2.4(b).

---

**(h)**: \(\tau_{a}(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2})=(\tau_{a}u_{1})*_{\bullet}u_{2}=u_{1}*_{\bullet}\tau_ {a}u_{2}\), \(a\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\), and

\[(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2})\,\tilde{\phantom{a}}=\tilde{u}_{1}*_{\bullet}\tilde{u}_ {2}\ .\]

ProofIt is easily verified that these convolutions are all well-defined. If \(u_{1}\) and \(u_{2}\) satisfy condition \((\Sigma)\), we deduce from (1.9.18) that we can assume that \(u_{1}\) and \(u_{2}\) have compact supports. Thus in either case it suffices by Theorem 1.9.1 to consider the case where \(u_{j}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\otimes E_{j}\). Now the assertion follows from Remark 1.2.4(c).
**(i)**: Suppose that \(a\in E_{1}\) and \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\). Then

\[\partial^{\alpha}\big{[}(\delta\otimes a)*_{\bullet}u\big{]}=(\partial^{\alpha }\delta\otimes a)*_{\bullet}u=a\bullet\partial^{\alpha}u=\partial^{\alpha}(a \bullet u)\]

for \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\).

ProofSince \(\partial^{\beta}\delta\otimes a\in\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\), we see that the above convolutions are well-defined. Thanks to (g) and Remark 1.6.5(f) we can assume that \(\alpha=0\). By Theorems 1.6.4 and 1.9.1 it suffices to consider \(u\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\times E_{2}\). Then the assertion follows from (1.9.1) and Remark 1.2.4(a).

### Convolution Algebras

Given a nonempty subset \(K\) of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), we put

\[\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{K}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E):=\big{\{}\,u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime} (\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ;\ \operatorname{supp}(u)\subset\overline{K}\,\big{\}}\] (1.9.22)

and, as usual, \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{K}(\mathbb{R}^{n}):=\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{K}(\mathbb{R}^ {n},\mathbb{K})\), if no confusion seems likely. We also set

\[\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E):=\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\mathbb{R}^{+}}(\mathbb{R} ,E)\ .\] (1.9.23)

Note that \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{K}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) is a closed linear subspace of \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

In the following theorem we collect some of the properties of convolutions in a particularly important setting.

**1.9.7 Theorem**: _Let \(\Gamma\) be a proper closed convex cone in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and let_

\[\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{D},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{E}^{\prime},\mathcal{D}^{ \prime}_{\Gamma}\}\ .\]

_Then convolution is a well-defined hypocontinuous bilinear map_

\[\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2}) \rightarrow\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ ,\quad(u_{1},u_{2})\mapsto u_{1}*_{ \bullet}u_{2}\]

_which possesses the associativity and commutativity properties of Remarks 1.9.6(c) and (d), respectively. In particular, if \((E,\bullet)\) is a \([\)commutative\(]\) Banach algebra then \(\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E),*_{\bullet}\big{)}\) is a \([\)commutative\(]\) algebra, a \(\mathbf{convolution}\) algebra. If \((E,\bullet)\) has a unit \(e_{0}\) and \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{E}^{\prime},\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\Gamma}\}\), then \(\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E),*_{\bullet}\big{)}\) has a unit as well, namely \(\delta\otimes e_{0}\)._

---

ProofEverything, except the hypocontinuity of the convolution map if \(\mathfrak{F}=\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\Gamma}\), follows easily from Theorem 1.9.1, the injection \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\hookrightarrow\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R }^{n},E_{2})\), and Remarks 1.9.5(c), 1.9.6(f), and 1.2.4(a). Recall that \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) is a closed linear subspace of \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). Thus, if \((u_{\alpha})\) is a net in \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) converging to zero, it converges to zero in \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\). Let \(V\) be a bounded subset of \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\), hence of \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\). Then, given any bounded subset \(B\) of \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), there exists \(K:=K_{B}\subset\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}\) such that \(\mathrm{supp}(\varphi)\subset\overline{K}\) for \(\varphi\in B\). Hence condition \((\Sigma)\) guarantees the existence of \(\rho>0\) such that \(x,y\in\Gamma\) with \(x+y\subset\overline{K}\) implies \(x,y\in\rho\mathbb{B}^{n}\). Thus, letting \(\psi_{j}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) satisfy \(\psi\,|\,\rho\mathbb{B}^{n}=1\), it follows from (1.9.18) that

\[u_{\alpha}\ast_{\bullet}v(\varphi)=(\psi_{1}u_{\alpha})\ast_{\bullet}(\psi_{2} v)(\varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in B\ ,\quad v\in V\ .\] (1.9.24)

Note that \(\psi_{2}v(\chi)=v(\psi_{2}\chi)\) and \(\psi_{2}\chi\in\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{supp}(\psi_{2})}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) for \(\chi\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) imply that \(\{\,\psi_{2}v\;;\;v\in V\;\}\) is bounded in \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\). Now the hypocontinuity of the map (1.9.2) and (1.9.24) entail \(u_{\alpha}\ast_{\bullet}v(\varphi)\to 0\) in \(E_{0}\), uniformly with respect to \(v\in V\) and \(\varphi\in B\). Consequently, \(u_{\alpha}\ast_{\bullet}v\to 0\) in \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\), hence in \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\), uniformly with respect to \(v\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\). This proves, by symmetry, the asserted hypocontinuity.

**1.9.8 Remarks**:
**(a)**: Let \(\Gamma\) be a proper, closed, and convex cone in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\). Then \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), and \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) are commutative convolution algebras. Moreover, \(\mathcal{E}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) possess the unit \(\delta\).
**(b)**: Since \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) are barreled, the convolution product is, in fact, continuous on these spaces.
**(c)**: Suppose that \(u_{j}\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E_{j})\) are regular distributions. Then \(u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E_{0})\) is a regular distribution as well, and

\[u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}u_{1}(t-s)\bullet u_{2}(s)\,ds\ , \qquad\text{a.a. }t\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\ .\]

ProofThis is an easy consequence of Remarks 1.9.6(b) and (f).

### Convolutions of Bounded and Integrable Functions

For the reader's convenience and for later use we now collect the properties of convolution on certain Banach spaces of vector-valued convolutions, thus extending, in particular, assertions [Ama95, (III.4.2.19)-(III.4.2.22)] (note that in that book (III.4.2.18) is a special case of (III.4.2.21)).

**1.9.9 Theorem**: _Suppose that \((\mathfrak{F}_{1},\mathfrak{F}_{2};\mathfrak{F}_{0})\) is any one of the triplets_

\[(BUC,L_{1};BUC),(C_{0},L_{1};C_{0}),(L_{p},L_{1};L_{p}),(L_{\infty},L_{1};BUC), (L_{q},L_{q^{\prime}};C_{0})\ ,\]

---

_where \(1\leq p<\infty\) and \(1<q<\infty\). Then convolution with respect to multiplication (1.5.20) extends from \(\mathfrak{F}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\) to a multiplication_

\[\mathfrak{F}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times\mathfrak{F}_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{ 2})\to\mathfrak{F}_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ .\]

_It is given by_

\[u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\!\!u_{1}(x-y)\bullet u_{2}(y)\, dy=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\!\!u_{1}(y)\bullet u_{2}(x-y)\,dy\ ,\ \ \ \ \mbox{a .a. }x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ .\]

Proof.: Since \(\mathfrak{F}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\hookrightarrow L_{1,\mathrm{loc}}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\cap\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\), we see from (1.9.3) that

\[u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ ,\qquad u_{1} \in\mathfrak{F}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\ ,\quad u_{2}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n} ,E_{2})\ ,\]

and Proposition 1.9.3 guarantees that \(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\) is given by the above integral in this case. Since \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\) is dense in \(\mathfrak{F}_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\), it suffices to show that \(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{1}\in\mathfrak{F}_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\) and that the estimate

\[\|u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\|_{\mathfrak{F}_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})}\leq\|u_{1} \|_{\mathfrak{F}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})}\,\|u_{2}\|_{\mathfrak{F}_{2}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})}\] (1.9.25)

is valid for \(u_{1}\in\mathfrak{F}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\). Then the assertion follows by continuous extension.

If \(u_{1}\in L_{r}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\), \(1\leq r\leq\infty\), and \(u_{2}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\), it follows from

\[|u_{1}*u_{2}(x)|\leq\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|u_{1}(x-y)|\,|u_{2}(y)|\,dy\ ,\qquad x \in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\]

and the classical scalar Young inequality that

\[\|u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\|_{L_{r}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})}\leq\|u_{1}\|_{L_{r}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})}\,\|u_{2}\|_{L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})}\] (1.9.26)

and

\[\|u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\|_{L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})}\leq\|u_{1}\|_{L_{ r}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})}\,\|u_{2}\|_{L_{r^{\prime}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})}\] (1.9.27)

(cf. [Ama95, (III.4.2.20)-(III.4.2.22)]). If \(u_{j}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{j})\) for \(j=1,2\), we know from (1.9.7) that \(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\). Since \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) is dense in \(\mathfrak{F}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) if \(\mathfrak{F}_{1}\) belongs to \(\{C_{0},L_{p},L_{q}\}\) and since \(C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\) is a closed linear subspace of \(L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\) containing \(\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\), we infer from (1.9.26) and (1.9.27) that the assertion is true for \(\mathfrak{F}_{1}\in\{C_{0},L_{p},L_{q}\}\).

If \(u_{1}\in BUC(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\) then, given \(\varepsilon>0\), there exists \(\delta>0\) such that \(|u_{1}(x)-u_{1}(y)|\leq\varepsilon\) for \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) with \(|x-y|\leq\delta\). Hence

\[|u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(x)-u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}(y)|\leq\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|u _{1}(x-z)-u_{1}(y-z)|\,|u_{2}(z)|\,dz\leq\varepsilon\,\|u_{2}\|_{1}\]

for \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) with \(|x-y|\leq\delta\). This shows that \(u_{1}*_{\bullet}u_{2}\in BUC(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\) in this case. Hence the assertion follows for \(\mathfrak{F}_{1}=BUC\) from (1.9.26) and the fact that \(BUC(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\) is a closed linear subspace of \(L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\).

---

Finally, suppose that \(u_{1}\in L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\). Then we infer from Remark 1.9.6(h) and (1.9.26) that

\[\|\tau_{a}(u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2})-u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}\|_{\infty}=\|u_{1 }\ast_{\bullet}(\tau_{a}u_{2}-u_{2})\|_{\infty}\leq\|u_{1}\|_{\infty}\,\|\tau_{a }u_{2}-u_{2}\|_{1}\]

for \(a\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\). Since the translation group is strongly continuous on \(L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\), it follows that \(u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}\in\mbox{\it BUC}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\) in this case. Thus the assertion holds for \(\mathfrak{F}_{1}=L_{\infty}\) as well.

Given the hypotheses of Theorem 1.9.9, inequality (1.9.25), that holds for all \(u_{j}\in\mathfrak{F}_{j}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{j})\), \(j=1,2\), is again called **Young's inequality**.

#### The Convolution Theorem

Lastly, we extend the convolution theorem to vector-valued distributions.

**1.9.10 Theorem**: _If \(u_{1}\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u_{2}\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\) then \((u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2})^{\widehat{\phantom{\bullet}}}=\widehat{u}_{1}\bullet \widehat{u}_{2}\)._

**Proof** Since \(\mathcal{F}\) is a toplinear automorphism of \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and of \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), it follows from Theorems 1.6.4 and 1.9.1, together with

\[\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E) \hookrightarrow\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\]

that the bilinear maps \((u_{1},u_{2})\mapsto(u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2})^{\widehat{\phantom{\bullet}}}\) and \((u_{1},u_{2})\mapsto\widehat{u}_{1}\bullet\widehat{u}_{2}\) are well-defined and hypocontinuous from \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_ {2})\) into \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\). Thanks to

\[(u\otimes e)^{\widehat{\phantom{\bullet}}}=\widehat{u}\otimes e\ ,\qquad u \otimes e\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\otimes E\ ,\]

we see from (1.6.10), (1.9.1), and the scalar convolution theorem that they coincide on the dense linear subspace \(\big{(}\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\otimes E_{1}\big{)}\times\big{(} \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\otimes E_{2}\big{)}\), hence everywhere.

**1.9.11 Remarks**: **(a)**: Let

\[\mathcal{O}^{\prime}_{C}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E):=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\mathcal{O}_{M}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E):=\big{\{}u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ;\ \mathcal{F}u\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\,\big{\}}\ ,\]

endowed with the unique locally convex topology such that

\[\mathcal{F}\in\mathcal{L}\mbox{is}\big{(}\mathcal{O}^{\prime}_{C}(\mathbb{R}^ {n},E),\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ .\]

Then it follows from Theorem 1.9.10, the continuity properties of \(\mathcal{F}\), and Theorem 1.6.4 that we can define a hypocontinuous bilinear map

\[\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times\mathcal{O}^{\prime}_{C}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\to\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ ,\quad(u_{1},u_{2})\mapsto u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}\ ,\] (1.9.28)

the **convolution with respect to multiplication** (1.5.20), by putting

\[u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}:=\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\widehat{u}_{1}\bullet\widehat{u}_ {2})\ ,\qquad u_{1}\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\ ,\quad u_{2}\in\mathcal{O}^{\prime}_{C}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2})\ .\] (1.9.29)

We leave it to the interested reader to carry over the properties of Remarks 1.9.6 to this more general case.

---

**(b)**: Given \(a\in{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\), we put

\[a(D)u:={\cal F}^{-1}a_{\bullet}{\cal F}u:={\cal F}^{-1}(a\bullet\widehat{u})\ , \qquad u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2})\ .\]

Then it follows from the isomorphism properties of the Fourier transform and from Theorem 1.6.4 that

\[a(D)\in{\cal L}\big{(}{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2}),{\cal S}^{ \prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{0})\big{)}\ .\]

Moreover,

\[a(D)u:={\cal F}^{-1}(a)*_{\bullet}u\ ,\qquad u\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2} )\ ,\]

thanks to the Convolution Theorem 1.9.10. Motivated by these facts we put

\[a(D)u:={\cal F}^{-1}(a_{\bullet}{\cal F})u:={\cal F}^{-1}(a)*_{\bullet}u\] (1.9.30)

whenever \(a\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\) and \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2})\) are such that the convolution product on the right-hand side is well-defined. In these general situations \(a(D)\) is said to be a **translation-invariant** (**pseudodifferential**) **operator** with **symbol**\(a\) (related to multiplication (1.5.20)). Of course, this is motivated by Theorem 1.2.2. Note that

\[a(D)\in{\cal L}\big{(}{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2}),{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{ n},E_{0})\big{)}\cap{\cal L}\big{(}{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2}),{ \cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{0})\big{)}\] (1.9.31)

if \(a\in{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{1})\).

ConventionIn the remainder of this work the multiplications which occur belong most of the time to one of the classes given in Examples 1.3.1(a)-(e). If this is the case, we usually omit the symbol \(\bullet\) everywhere, e.g., we simply write \(*\) for \(*_{\bullet}\) , etc. Note, for instance, that, if \(\bullet\) is the multiplication of Example 1.3.1(b), then (1.9.31) reduces to

\[a(D)\in{\cal L}\big{(}{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)}\cap{\cal L}\big{(}{ \cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\]

an assertion that has already been given in Chapter III. Similarly, using this particular multiplication, many of the results of the present subsection reduce to assertions given, and having been used already, in [10]. Nevertheless, even in this simpler situation we shall refer to the theorems and results formulated and proven in the present subsection since this is the place where all essential properties have been collected.

### Laplace Transforms

In this subsection we restrict ourselves to the consideration of distributions in one variable, that is, on \({\mathbb{R}}\) only, although most of the results below have extensions to distributions on \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\). However, the one-dimensional case is the most important one and the only one we shall make use of.

---

**Definition of Laplace Transforms**

For abbreviation we put

\[e_{z}:=(x\mapsto e^{-zx})\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}})\ ,\qquad z\in{\mathbb{C}}\ .\]

Then, given \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\), we set

\[I_{u}:=\big{\{}\,\xi\in{\mathbb{R}}\ ;\ e_{\xi}u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}} ,E)\,\big{\}}\ .\]

Of course, \(I_{u}\) may be empty, as is the case for \(u\in L_{1,{\rm loc}}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) with \(u(x)=e^{x^{2}}u_{0}\) for some nonzero \(u_{0}\in E\). Moreover, \(0\in I_{u}\) iff \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\). The following lemma shows that \(I_{u}\) is convex.

**1.10.1 Lemma**: \(I_{u}\) _is an interval._

**Proof** For \(\xi_{0},\xi_{1}\in I_{u}\) and \(t\in[0,1]\) put \(\xi:=(1-t)\xi_{0}+t\xi_{1}\). Since

\[e_{\xi}=(e_{\xi_{0}})^{1-t}(e_{\xi_{1}})^{t}\leq e_{\xi_{0}}+e_{\xi_{1}}\]

it is easily verified that \(\chi:=e_{\xi}\big{/}(e_{\xi_{0}}+e_{\xi_{1}})\in BC^{\infty}({\mathbb{R}}) \hookrightarrow{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}})\).Consequently, \(e_{\xi}u=\chi e_{\xi_{0}}u+\chi e_{\xi_{1}}u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}} ,E)\), which proves the assertion.

The next lemma gives more detailed information on \(I_{u}\) if the support of \(u\) is limited to the left.

**1.10.2 Lemma**: _Suppose that \(\inf\mbox{supp}(u)>-\infty\). Then \(\sup I_{u}=\infty\) if \(I_{u}\neq\emptyset\)._

**Proof** Let \(\mbox{supp}(u)\subset[\alpha,\infty)\) for some \(\alpha\in{\mathbb{R}}\). Fix \(\xi_{0}\in I_{u}\) and \(\psi\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}})\) with \(\psi\,|\,[\alpha-1,\infty)=1\) and \(\psi\,|\,(-\infty,\alpha-2]=0\). Then, given \(\xi>\xi_{0}\),

\[a(\xi):=e_{\xi-\xi_{0}}\psi\in BC^{\infty}({\mathbb{R}})\hookrightarrow{\cal O }_{M}({\mathbb{R}})\]

and, consequently, \(e_{\xi}u=a(\xi)e_{\xi_{0}}u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\). Hence \(\xi\in I_{u}\) for \(\xi>\xi_{0}\).

**1.10.3 Remarks** (a) If \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\) and \(\xi_{0}\in I_{u}\) then \([\xi_{0},\infty)\subset I_{u}\). In particular, \({\mathbb{R}}^{+}\subset I_{u}\) if \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\cap{\cal D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\).

**Proof** This is an obvious consequence of Lemma 1.10.2.

**(b) If \(u\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) then \(I_{u}={\mathbb{R}}\).

**Proof** Since \(e_{\xi}\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}})\) for \(\xi\in{\mathbb{R}}\) we know from Lemma 1.6.3 that \(e_{\xi}u\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) for \(u\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\). Hence the assertion follows from \({\cal E}^{\prime}\hookrightarrow{\cal S}^{\prime}\).

Next we prove the basic technical lemma that will allow us to define Laplace transformations for certain distributions.

---

**1.10.4 Lemma** _Suppose that \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\). Then \(\widehat{e_{\xi}u}\in{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) for \(\xi\in\dot{\hat{I}}_{u}\), and the map_

\[\dot{\hat{I}}_{u}\to{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}},E)\ ,\quad\xi\mapsto\widehat{e_{ \xi}u}\]

_is smooth._

**Proof** Fix \(\xi_{0},\xi_{1}\in\dot{\hat{I}}_{u}\) with \(\xi_{0}<\xi_{1}\), and \(\varphi_{0}\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}})\) with \(0\leq\varphi_{0}\leq 1\) such that \(\varphi_{0}\,|\,{\mathbb{R}}^{+}=1\) and \(\varphi_{0}(x)=0\) for \(x\leq-1\). Also put \(\varphi_{1}:=1-\varphi_{0}\). Then

\[e_{\xi}u=e_{\xi-\xi_{0}}\varphi_{0}e_{\xi_{0}}u+e_{\xi-\xi_{1}}\varphi_{1}e_{ \xi_{1}}u\ ,\qquad\xi\in{\mathbb{R}}\ .\]

It is easily verified that

\[a_{j}:=(\xi\mapsto e_{\xi-\xi_{j}}\varphi_{j})\in C^{\infty}\bigl{(}(\xi_{0}, \xi_{1}),{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}})\bigr{)}\ ,\qquad j=0,1\ .\]

Hence

\[\widehat{a}_{j}\in C^{\infty}\bigl{(}(\xi_{0},\xi_{1}),{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}) \bigr{)}\ ,\qquad j=0,1\ ,\]

since \({\cal F}\in{\cal L}{\rm aut}\bigl{(}{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}})\bigr{)}\). From (1.10.1) and the convolution theorem we infer that

\[\widehat{e_{\xi}u}=\widehat{a_{0}e_{\xi_{0}}u}+\widehat{a_{1}e_{\xi_{1}}u}=(2 \pi)^{n}\bigl{(}\widehat{a}_{0}*\widehat{e_{\xi_{0}}u}+\widehat{a}_{1}* \widehat{e_{\xi_{1}}u}\bigr{)}\]

for \(\xi\in(\xi_{0},\xi_{1})\), thanks to \(\widehat{u}=(2\pi)^{n}\tilde{u}\) and Remark 1.9.6(h). Since \({\cal F}\) is a continuous automorphism of \({\cal S}\) and of \({\cal S}^{\prime}\) we infer from Proposition 1.2.7 that

\[(\varphi\mapsto\widehat{\varphi}*\widehat{v})\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal S}({ \mathbb{R}}),{\cal O}_{M}\left({\mathbb{R}},E\right)\bigr{)}\ ,\qquad v\in{\cal S }^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\ .\]

Now the assertion is a consequence of (1.10.2) and (1.10.3).

Suppose that \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) and \(\dot{\hat{I}}_{u}\neq\emptyset\). Then \(u\) is said to be **Laplace transformable** and the \(E\)-valued function

\[\widetilde{u}:\ \dot{\hat{I}}_{u}+i\,{\mathbb{R}}\to E\ ,\quad\zeta:=\xi+i\, \eta\mapsto\widetilde{u}(\zeta):=\widehat{e_{\xi}u}(\eta)\]

is the **Laplace transform** (or **transformation**) of \(u\). Note that \(\widetilde{u}\) is well-defined by Lemma 1.10.4.

**Weakly Holomorphic Functions**

Now we prove some facts about \(E\)-valued holomorphic functions that we need to derive further properties of Laplace transforms.

Recall that a function \(f:\,X\to E\), where \(X\) is an open subset of \({\mathbb{C}}\) (and \(E\) is a complex Banach space) is holomorphic iff it is (complex) differentiable. It is **weakly holomorphic** if \(e^{\prime}\circ f:\,X\to{\mathbb{C}}\) is holomorphic for each \(e^{\prime}\in E^{\prime}\).

**1.10.5 Proposition** _Let \(X\) be open in \({\mathbb{C}}\). Then \(f\in E^{X}\) is holomorphic iff it is weakly holomorphic._

---

**Proof** Suppose that \(f\) is weakly holomorphic. Let \(z_{0}\in X\) be given and choose \(r>0\) such that \(\bar{\mathbb{R}}_{\mathbb{C}}(z_{0},2r)\subset X\). Given \(e^{\prime}\in E^{\prime}\), Cauchy's integral formula implies

\[(\alpha-\beta)^{-1}\Big{[}\frac{e^{\prime}\circ f(z_{0}+\alpha)-e^ {\prime}\circ f(z_{0})}{\alpha}-\frac{e^{\prime}\circ f(z_{0}+\beta)-e^{\prime }\circ f(z_{0})}{\beta}\Big{]}\] \[=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|z-z_{0}|=2r}\frac{e^{\prime}\circ f(z)\,dz} {(z-z_{0}-\alpha)(z-z_{0}-\beta)(z-z_{0})}\]

for \(\alpha,\beta\in r\dot{\mathbb{B}}_{\mathbb{C}}\) with \(\alpha\neq\beta\). Since the integral is uniformly bounded for these \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), the uniform boundedness principle implies the existence of a constant \(c\) such that

\[\Big{|}\frac{f(z_{0}+\alpha)-f(z_{0})}{\alpha}-\frac{f(z_{0}+\beta)-f(z_{0})}{ \beta}\Big{|}\leq c\,|\alpha-\beta|\enspace,\qquad\alpha,\beta\in r\dot{ \mathbb{B}}_{\mathbb{C}}\enspace.\]

Now we deduce from the completeness of \(E\) that \(f\) is differentiable in \(z_{0}\). Hence \(f\) is holomorphic. The converse is obvious.

As usual, we identify \(\mathbb{C}\) and \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\) by means of the canonical identification

\[\mathbb{C}\ni z=x+i\,y\quad\longleftrightarrow\quad(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\enspace.\]

Then \(f\in E^{X}\) can be interpreted as a function of the complex variable \(z\in X\subset\mathbb{C}\) or as a function of the real variables \((x,y)\in X\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\). We write \(\partial\) for the complex derivative \(\partial_{z}\) and say that \(f\) is real differentiable if \(f\) is differentiable with respect to the real variables \((x,y)\in X\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\).

**1.10.6 Corollary** _Let \(X\) be open in \(\mathbb{C}\). Then \(f\in E^{X}\) is holomorphic iff \(f\) is real differentiable and \(\overline{\partial}f=0\), where_

\[\overline{\partial}:=\partial_{\overline{z}}:=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_{x}+i\, \partial_{y})\ ,\qquad z=x+i\,y\ .\]

_If this is the case then \(\partial f=\partial_{z}f=\partial_{x}f\)._

**Proof** Given \(e^{\prime}\in E^{\prime}\), it follows that \(\overline{\partial}(e^{\prime}\circ f)=e^{\prime}\circ(\overline{\partial}f)\). Hence \(\overline{\partial}f=0\) iff \(e^{\prime}\circ f\) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann differential equations for each \(e^{\prime}\in E^{\prime}\), that is, iff \(f\) is weakly holomorphic, hence holomorphic by Proposition 1.10.5. If this is true then

\[e^{\prime}\circ\partial f=\partial(e^{\prime}\circ f)=\partial_{x}\big{(} \mathrm{Re}(e^{\prime}\circ f)\big{)}+i\,\partial_{x}(\mathrm{Im}(e^{\prime} \circ f)\big{)}=\partial_{x}(e^{\prime}\circ f)=e^{\prime}\circ\partial_{x}f\]

for each \(e^{\prime}\in E^{\prime}\). Hence \(\partial f=\partial_{x}f\).

**Holomorphy of Laplace Transforms**

After these preparations we can show that the Laplace transform of a distribution is a holomorphic function. At the end of this subsection we shall derive more precise information about its behavior at infinity.

---

**1.10.7 Theorem**: _If \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) is Laplace transformable then \(\widetilde{u}\) is holomorphic._

**Proof** From Lemma 1.10.4 we know already that \(\widetilde{u}\in C^{\infty}(\dot{\tilde{I}}_{u}\times i\,{\mathbb{R}},E)\). Writing \(\zeta=\xi+i\eta\) it is easily seen that

\[\partial_{\xi}\widetilde{u}(\zeta)=-(Xe_{\xi}u)^{\frown}(\eta)\ ,\] (1.10.4)

where \(X\) denotes multiplication with the independent variable. On the other hand,

\[\eqalign{(\partial_{\eta}\widetilde{u})(\varphi)&=-\widetilde{u}(\partial \varphi)=-\widehat{e_{\xi}u}(\partial\varphi)=-u\bigl{(}e_{\xi}\widehat{ \partial\varphi}\bigr{)}\cr&=-i\,u\bigl{(}e_{\xi}X\widehat{\varphi}\bigr{)}=-i \,(Xe_{\xi}u)^{\frown}(\varphi)\cr}\]

for \(\varphi\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}})\). Hence \(\overline{\partial}\widetilde{u}=0\) and the assertion follows from Corollary 1.10.6.

**1.10.8 Corollary**: _If \(u\in{\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) then \(\widehat{u}\) extends to an \(E\)-valued entire analytic function on \({\mathbb{C}}\), the Laplace transform \(\widetilde{u}\) of \(u\)._

**Properties of Laplace Transforms**

Thanks to the close relationship between the Fourier and the Laplace transforms the latter enjoy many properties that are similar to some of those we know to hold for the former.

**1.10.9 Proposition**: _Suppose that \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) is Laplace transformable. Then_

* \(\partial^{k}\widetilde{u}=(-1)^{k}(X^{k}u)^{\frown}\)_,_ \(k\in{\mathbb{N}}\)_, where_ \(X^{k}\) _denotes multiplication with the function_ \(x\mapsto x^{k}\)_._
* \(I_{\partial^{k}u}\supset I_{u}\) _and_ \[(\partial^{k}u)^{\frown}(\zeta)=\zeta^{k}\widetilde{u}(\zeta)\ ,\qquad\zeta\in\dot{I}_{u}+i\,{\mathbb{R}}\ ,\] _for_ \(k\in{\mathbb{N}}\)_._
* \(\tau_{\alpha}u\) _is Laplace transformable for_ \(\alpha\in{\mathbb{R}}\) _and_ \[(\tau_{\alpha}u)^{\frown}(\zeta)=e^{-\alpha\zeta}\,\widetilde{u}(\zeta)\ , \qquad\zeta\in\dot{\tilde{I}}_{u}+i\,{\mathbb{R}}\ .\]

**Proof** (i) follows from (1.10.4), Theorem 1.10.7, and Corollary 1.10.6.

(ii) Note that \(e_{\xi}\partial u=\partial(e_{\xi}u)+\xi e_{\xi}u\) for \(\xi\in{\mathbb{R}}\). Thus \(e_{\xi}\partial u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) if \(\xi\in I_{u}\). Consequently,

\[(\partial u)^{\frown}(\zeta)=(e_{\xi}\partial u)^{\frown}(\eta)=\bigl{(} \partial(e_{\xi}u)\bigr{)}^{\frown}+\xi\widetilde{u}=i\,\eta\,\widehat{e_{\xi }u}+\xi\widetilde{u}=\zeta\,\widetilde{u}\]

for \(\zeta\in\dot{\tilde{I}}_{u}+i\,{\mathbb{R}}\). Now the assertion follows by induction.

---

(iii) Observe that \(e_{\xi}\tau_{\alpha}u=e^{-\alpha\xi}\tau_{\alpha}(e_{\xi}u)\) for \(\xi\in\mathbb{R}\). Consequently,

\[\eqalignno{(\tau_{\alpha}u)^{\sim}(\zeta)&=(e_{\xi}\tau_{\alpha}u)^{\sim}(\eta)=e ^{-\alpha\xi}\bigl{(}\tau_{\alpha}(e_{\xi}u)\bigr{)}^{\sim}(\eta)\cr&=e^{-( \alpha\xi+i\,\alpha\eta)}\widehat{e_{\xi}u}(\eta)=e^{-\alpha\zeta}\,\widetilde {u}(\zeta)\cr}\]

for \(\zeta\in\dot{\hat{I}}_{u}+i\,\mathbb{R}\), thanks to [Ama95, (III.4.2.6)].

**1.10.10 Example** \((\partial^{k}\delta_{\alpha})^{\sim}(\zeta)=\zeta^{k}e^{-\alpha\zeta}\), \(\zeta\in\mathbb{C}\), \(\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\).

Next we prove an important and useful result, namely the convolution theorem for Laplace transforms.

**1.10.11 Theorem** _Let \(E_{1}\times E_{2}\to E_{0}\), \((e_{1},e_{2})\mapsto e_{1}\bullet e_{2}\) be a multiplication and suppose that \(u_{j}\in\Cal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R},E_{j})\), \(j=1,2\), are Laplace transformable, have convolutive supports, and satisfy \(\dot{\hat{I}}_{u_{1}}\cap\dot{\hat{I}}_{u_{2}}\neq\emptyset\). Then \(u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}\in\Cal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R},E_{0}\,)\) is Laplace transformable as well, and_

\[(u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2})^{\sim}(\zeta)=\widetilde{u}_{1}(\zeta)\bullet \widetilde{u}_{2}(\zeta)\ ,\qquad\zeta\in\bigl{(}\dot{\hat{I}}_{u_{1}}\cap\dot{\hat{I}}_{u_{2}}\bigr{)}+i \,\mathbb{R}\ .\]

**Proof** From (1.9.18) we know that \(u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}\) is a well-defined element of \(\Cal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R},E_{0}\,)\). Given \(\xi\in\dot{\hat{I}}_{u_{1}}\cap\dot{\hat{I}}_{u_{2}}\), it follows from \(e_{\xi}u_{j}\in\Cal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R},E_{j})\), Remark 1.9.11(a), and Lemma 1.10.4 that

\[\bigl{(}(e_{\xi}u_{1})\ast_{\bullet}(e_{\xi}u_{2})\bigr{)}^{\sim}=\widehat{e_ {\xi}u_{1}}\bullet\widehat{e_{\xi}u_{2}}\ .\]

Let \(X\) be a bounded interval in \(\mathbb{R}\). Since \(u_{1}\) and \(u_{2}\) satisfy condition \((\Sigma)\) there exists \(\rho>0\) such that \(x_{j}\in\operatorname{supp}(u_{j})\) and \(x_{1}+x_{2}\in X\) imply \(|x_{j}|<\rho\) for \(j=1,2\). Let \(\psi_{j}\in\Cal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\) satisfy \(\psi_{j}\,|[-\rho,\rho]=1\). Then, thanks to the definition of \((e_{\xi}u_{1})\ast(e_{\xi}u_{2})\), given \(\varphi\in\Cal{D}(\mathbb{R})\) with \(\operatorname{supp}(\varphi)\subset X\), it follows that

\[\eqalignno{(e_{\xi}u_{1})\ast_{\bullet}(e_{\xi}u_{2})(\varphi)&=e_{\xi}\psi_{1 }u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}e_{\xi}\psi_{2}u_{2}\bigl{(}\varphi(x_{1}+x_{2})\bigr{)} \cr&=\psi_{1}u_{1}\otimes_{\bullet}\psi_{2}u_{2}\bigl{(}(e_{\xi}\varphi)(x_{1}+ x_{2})\bigr{)}=u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2}(e_{\xi}\varphi)\cr&=e_{\xi}(u_{1}\ast_{ \bullet}u_{2})(\varphi)\ .\cr}\]

Thus we infer from (1.10.5) that

\[\bigl{(}e_{\xi}(u_{1}\ast_{\bullet}u_{2})\bigr{)}^{\sim}=\widehat{e_{\xi}u_{1 }}\bullet\widehat{e_{\xi}u_{2}}\ ,\qquad\xi\in\dot{\hat{I}}_{1}\cap\dot{\hat{I}}_{2}\ ,\]

which, thanks to the definition of the Laplace transform, proves the theorem.

**Laplace Transformable Distributions in \(\Cal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\)**

In the remainder of this subsection we restrict ourselves to the most important case, that is, to the case of Laplace transformable distributions whose supports

---

are bounded below. Thanks to Proposition 1.10.9(iii) and the fact that

\[\operatorname{supp}(u)\subset[\alpha,\infty)\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \operatorname{supp}(\tau_{\alpha}u)\subset\mathbb{R}^{+}\] (1.10.6)

for \(\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\) and \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R},E)\), it is no loss of generality to consider only Laplace transformable distributions belonging to \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\). Thus we put

\[\mathcal{L}\mathrm{ap}_{+}(E):=\{\,u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\ ;\ I_{u} \neq\emptyset\,\}\ .\]

From Lemma 1.10.2 we know that \(\sup I_{u}=\infty\) for \(u\in\mathcal{L}\mathrm{ap}_{+}(E)\), and we introduce \(\omega_{0}(u)\), the **abscissa of holomorphy** of \(\widetilde{u}\), by

\[\omega_{0}(u):=\inf I_{u}\ .\]

Then \(\widetilde{u}\) is defined and holomorphic on \(\big{[}\mathrm{Re}\,z>\omega_{0}(u)\big{]}\) with values in \(E\).

Suppose that \(u\in\mathcal{L}\mathrm{ap}_{+}(E)\). Fix \(\psi_{j}\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R})\), satisfying \(\operatorname{supp}(\psi_{j})\subset[-2,\infty)\) and \(\psi_{j}|\,[-1,\infty)=1\) for \(j=0,1\). Also let \(\xi_{1}>\xi_{0}>\omega_{0}(u)\). Then \(\psi_{j}e_{\zeta-\xi_{j}}\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})\) for \(\mathrm{Re}\,\zeta>\xi_{1}\) and \(e_{\xi_{j}}u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R},E)\) for \(j=0,1\). Hence \(e_{\xi_{j}}u(\psi_{j}e_{\zeta-\xi_{j}})\) is well-defined for \(j=0,1\) and \(\mathrm{Re}\,\zeta>\xi_{1}\). Note that

\[\begin{split} e_{\xi_{0}}u(\psi_{0}e_{\zeta-\xi_{0}})& =e_{\xi_{0}}u(\psi_{0}\psi_{1}e_{\xi_{1}-\xi_{0}}e_{\zeta-\xi_{1}}) =\psi_{0}e_{\xi_{1}-\xi_{0}}e_{\xi_{0}}u(\psi_{1}e_{\zeta-\xi_{1}})\\ &=e_{\xi_{1}}u(\psi_{1}e_{\zeta-\xi_{1}})\end{split}\] (1.10.7)

for \(\mathrm{Re}\,\zeta>\xi_{1}\), thanks to \(\psi_{0}e_{\xi_{1}-\xi_{0}}\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})\) and \(\psi_{j}=1\) in a neighborhood of \(\operatorname{supp}(u)\). This shows that, given any \(u\in\mathcal{L}\mathrm{ap}_{+}(E)\) and \(\zeta\in\mathbb{C}\) with \(\mathrm{Re}\,\zeta>\omega_{0}(u)\),

\[u(e_{\zeta}):=e_{\xi_{0}}u(\psi_{0}e_{\zeta-\xi_{0}})\] (1.10.8)

is well-defined, independently of \(\xi_{0}\in\big{(}\omega_{0}(u),\mathrm{Re}\,\zeta\big{)}\) and \(\psi_{0}\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R})\), provided \(\psi_{0}=1\) in a neighborhood of \(\operatorname{supp}(u)\) and \(\psi_{0}\) vanishes near \(-\infty\).

**1.10.12 Theorem**: _If \(u\in\mathcal{L}\mathrm{ap}_{+}(E)\) then \(\widetilde{u}(\zeta)=u(e_{\zeta})\) for \(\mathrm{Re}\,\zeta>\omega_{0}(u)\)._

**Proof** Write \(\xi+i\,\eta=\zeta\) and fix \(\xi_{0}\in\big{(}\omega_{0}(u),\xi\big{)}\) and \(\psi_{0}\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R})\) vanishing near \(-\infty\) and being equal to \(1\) in \([-1,\infty)\). Then, given \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R})\), the arguments of (1.10.7) show that

\[\widetilde{u}(\xi+i\ \cdot)(\varphi)=\widehat{e_{\xi}u}(\varphi)=e_{\xi}u( \widehat{\varphi})=e_{\xi_{0}}u(e_{\xi-\xi_{0}}\psi_{0}\widehat{\varphi})\ .\]

Note that

\[(e_{\xi-\xi_{0}}\psi_{0}\widehat{\varphi})(\eta)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}e^{-(\xi-\xi _{0})\eta}\psi_{0}(\eta)e^{-i\,\eta x}\varphi(x)\,dx\]

and \(e_{\xi_{0}}u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\) imply

\[\begin{split} e_{\xi_{0}}u(e_{\xi-\xi_{0}}\psi_{0}\widehat{ \varphi})&=\int_{\mathbb{R}}e_{\xi_{0}}u(e_{\xi-\xi_{0}+i\,x} \psi_{0})\varphi(x)\,dx=\int_{\mathbb{R}}u(e_{\xi+i\,x})\varphi(x)\,dx\\ &=u(e_{\xi+i\,.})(\varphi)\ ,\end{split}\]

as is easily verified. This proves the assertion.

---

**1.10.13 Corollary**: _Suppose that \(u\in L_{1,{\rm loc}}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) has its support in \({\mathbb{R}}^{+}\) and satisfies_

\[\omega(u):=\inf\bigl{\{}\,\omega\in{\mathbb{R}}\ ;\ e_{\omega}u\in L_{1}({ \mathbb{R}},E)\,\bigr{\}}<\infty\ .\] (1.10.9)

_Then \(u\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\) with \(\omega_{0}(u)\leq\omega(u)\), and_

\[\widetilde{u}(\zeta)=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\zeta x}u(x)\,dx\ ,\qquad{\rm Re}\, \zeta>\omega(u)\ .\] (1.10.10)

ProofIt suffices to recall that \(L_{1}({\mathbb{R}},E)\hookrightarrow{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\).

It should be remarked that \(\omega(u)\) is called abscissa of absolute convergence of the Laplace integral of \(u\), which is the integral appearing in (1.10.10).

**1.10.14 Examples**: Suppose that \(A\in{\cal G}(E,M,\sigma)\) for some \(M\geq 1\) and \(\sigma\in{\mathbb{R}}\).

**(a)**: Put \(e_{A}(t):=e^{-tA}\) for \(t\geq 0\), and \(e_{A}(t):=0\) for \(t<0\). Then \(e_{A}\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}\bigl{(}{\cal L}(E)\bigr{)}\) and \(\widetilde{e_{A}}(\zeta)=(\zeta+A)^{-1}\) for \({\rm Re}\,\zeta>\sigma\).

ProofIt is easily verified that \(\omega(e_{A})\leq\sigma\). From semigroup theory it is known that

\[(\zeta+A)^{-1}=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\zeta t}e^{-tA}\,dt\ ,\qquad{\rm Re}\, \zeta>\sigma\ .\]

Hence Corollary 1.10.13 implies the assertion.

**(b)**: Given \(z\in{\mathbb{C}}\), put \(u_{z}(t):=t^{z-1}e^{-tA}\) for \(t>0\), and \(u_{z}(t):=0\) for \(t<0\). Then \(u_{z}\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}\bigl{(}{\cal L}(E)\bigr{)}\) for \({\rm Re}\,z>0\), and \(\widetilde{u}_{z}(\zeta)=\Gamma(z)(\zeta+A)^{-z}\) for \({\rm Re}\,\zeta>\sigma\).

ProofAgain \(\sigma(u_{z})\leq\sigma\) for \({\rm Re}\,z>0\), and

\[\widetilde{u}(\zeta)=\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z-1}e^{-(\zeta+A)t}\,dt\ ,\qquad{\rm Re }\,\zeta>\sigma\ ,\]

by Corollary 1.10.13. Now the assertion follows from [Ama95, Theorem III.4.6.6].

**An Inversion Formula**: Using the fact that \({\cal F}\) is an automorphism of \({\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}},E)\), it is possible to recover the distribution \(u\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\) from its Laplace transform.

**1.10.15 Theorem**: _Suppose that \(u\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\). Then_

\[u=e_{-\xi}{\cal F}^{-1}\widetilde{u}(\xi+i\ \cdot\ )\ ,\qquad\xi>\omega_{0}(u)\ .\] (1.10.11)

_If \(\widetilde{u}(\xi+i\ \cdot\ )\in L_{1}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) for some \(\xi>\omega_{0}(u)\) then \(e_{\xi}u\in C_{0}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) and_

\[u(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\xi-i\,\infty}^{\xi+i\,\infty}e^{xz}\,\widetilde{u }(z)\,dz\ ,\qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}\ .\] (1.10.12)

---

ProofThe first assertion follows directly from the definition of \(\widetilde{u}\). If \(\widetilde{u}(\xi+i\ \cdot\ )\) is integrable over \({\mathbb{R}}\) for some \(\xi>\omega_{0}(u)\) then the Riemann-Lebesgue theorem guarantees that \(e_{\xi}u={\cal F}^{-1}\widetilde{u}(\xi+i\ \cdot\ )\in C_{0}({\mathbb{R}},E)\). Moreover,

\[u(x)=\frac{e^{\xi x}}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{i\,x\eta}\,\widetilde{u}( \xi+i\eta)\,d\eta\ ,\qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}\ ,\]

so that (1.10.12) is obvious.

**1.10.16 Remarks**: **(a)** From (1.10.11) we obtain immediately a _uniqueness theorem for Laplace transforms_: If \(u,v\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\) and there is \(\xi>\max\bigl{(}\omega_{0}(u),\omega_{0}(v)\bigr{)}\) with \(\widetilde{u}\,|\,(\xi+i\,{\mathbb{R}})=\widetilde{v}\,|\,(\xi+i\,{\mathbb{R}})\), then \(u=v\).
**(b)** It should be remarked that \({\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\) is a vector subspace of \({\cal D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\) and that the Laplace transform satisfies

\[(u+\alpha v)^{\sim}(\zeta)=\widetilde{u}(\zeta)+\alpha\widetilde{v}(\zeta)\ , \qquad{\rm Re}\,\zeta>\omega_{0}(w)\vee\omega_{0}(v)\ ,\]

for \(u,v\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\) and \(\alpha\in{\mathbb{R}}\).

**Characterization of Laplace Transforms**

Let \(X\) be open in \({\mathbb{K}}^{n}\). Then \(f\in E^{X}\) is said to be **polynomially bounded** in \(X\) if there exist \(c\geq 0\) and \(k\in{\mathbb{N}}\) such that

\[|f(x)|\leq c(1+|x|)^{k}\ ,\qquad x\in X\ .\]

Using this definition we now characterize those \(E\)-valued functions that are Laplace transforms of distributions in \({\cal D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\).

**1.10.17 Theorem**: _Suppose that \(u\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\). Then \(\widetilde{u}\) is holomorphic in the half-plane \(\bigl{[}{\rm Re}\,z>\omega_{0}(u)\bigr{]}\) and polynomially bounded on \(\bigl{[}{\rm Re}\,z\geq\omega\bigr{]}\) for each \(\omega>\omega_{0}(u)\). Conversely, suppose that \(\omega\geq 0\) and \(v:\,\bigl{[}{\rm Re}\,z>\omega\bigr{]}\to E\) is holomorphic and polynomially bounded on \(\bigl{[}{\rm Re}\,z\geq\omega^{\prime}\bigr{]}\) for each \(\omega^{\prime}>\omega\). Then \(v\) is the Laplace transform of some \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\), and \(\omega_{0}(u)\leq\omega\)._

Proof(i) Suppose that \(u\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\). Then \(\widetilde{u}\) is holomorphic in \(\bigl{[}{\rm Re}\,z>\omega_{0}(u)\bigr{]}\) by Lemma 1.10.2 and Theorem 1.10.7. Fix \(\omega>\omega_{0}(u)\) and put \(v:=e_{\omega}u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\). Then there exist \(k,m\in{\mathbb{N}}\) such that

\[|v(\varphi)|\leq cq_{k,m}(\varphi)\ ,\qquad\varphi\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}})\ .\] (1.10.13)

Choose \(\psi\in{\cal E}({\mathbb{R}})\) such that \({\rm supp}(\psi)\subset(-2,\infty)\) and \(\psi\,|\,(-1,\infty)=1\). Then, thanks to (1.10.8) and Proposition 1.10.12,

\[\widetilde{u}(\zeta)=v(\psi e_{\xi-\omega})\ ,\qquad{\rm Re}\,\zeta\geq\omega> \omega_{0}\ .\] (1.10.14)

From this and (1.10.13) we infer that \(\widetilde{u}\) is polynomially bounded on \(\bigl{[}{\rm Re}\,z\geq\omega\bigr{]}\) for each \(\omega>\omega_{0}(u)\).

---

(ii) First we consider the special case that \(f:\ [{\rm Re}\,z>\omega]\to E\) is holomorphic for some \(\omega\in{\mathbb{R}}\), and that

\[|f(\zeta)|\leq c(1+|\zeta|)^{-2}\ ,\qquad{\rm Re}\,\zeta>\omega\ .\]

Then \(f(\xi+i\ \cdot\ )\in L_{1}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) for \(\xi>\omega\). Motivated by Theorem 1.10.15 we put

\[u(x):={1\over 2\pi i}\int_{\xi-i\,\infty}^{\xi+i\,\infty}e^{x\xi}f(\zeta)\,d \zeta\ ,\qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}\ .\]

Since (1.10.15) implies

\[|e^{x\zeta}f(\zeta)|\leq{ce^{x\xi}\over 1+\eta^{2}}\ ,\qquad\zeta=\xi+i\,\eta\ , \quad\xi>\omega\ ,\]

a standard application of Cauchy's theorem shows that the integral in (1.10.16) is independent of \(\xi>\omega\). Rewriting (1.10.16) in the form

\[(e_{\xi}u)(x)={1\over 2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{i\,x\eta}f(\xi+i\eta)\,d \eta={\cal F}^{-1}\bigl{(}f(\xi+i\,\cdot\,)\bigr{)}(x)\ ,\qquad x\in{ \mathbb{R}}\ ,\]

we deduce from the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma that \(e_{\xi}u\in C_{0}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) and that

\[f(\xi+i\eta)=\widehat{e_{\xi}u}(\eta)\ ,\qquad\xi>\omega\ ,\quad\eta\in{ \mathbb{R}}\ .\]

From (1.10.15) and (1.10.17) we infer that

\[|u(x)|\leq c{e^{\xi x}\over 2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{d\eta\over 1+\eta^{2}} \leq ce^{\xi x}\ ,\qquad\xi>\omega\ ,\quad x\in{\mathbb{R}}\ .\]

Since \(u\in C({\mathbb{R}},E)\) we see from this estimate that \(u(x)=0\) for \(x<0\). Hence \({\rm supp}(u)\) is contained in \({\mathbb{R}}^{+}\). This shows that \(u\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\) and \(\widetilde{u}(\zeta)=f(\zeta)\) for \({\rm Re}\,\zeta>\omega\).

Now suppose that \(\omega\geq 0\) and \(g:\ [{\rm Re}\,z>\omega]\to E\) is holomorphic and, given \(\omega^{\prime}>\omega\), there exist \(c>0\) and \(m\in{\mathbb{N}}\) such that

\[|g(\zeta)|\leq c(1+|\zeta|)^{m}\ ,\qquad{\rm Re}\,\zeta>\omega^{\prime}\ .\]

Put \(f(\zeta):=\zeta^{-m-2}g(\zeta)\) for \({\rm Re}\,\zeta>\omega\). Then \(f\) is holomorphic in \([{\rm Re}\,z>\omega]\) and satisfies an estimate of the form (1.10.15) on \([{\rm Re}\,z\geq\omega^{\prime}]\). Hence, by what has already been shown and since (1.10.19) holds for each \(\omega^{\prime}>\omega\), there exists \(u\in{\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\) with \(\widetilde{u}(\zeta)=f(\zeta)\) for \({\rm Re}\,\zeta>\omega\). Then \(v:=\partial^{m+2}u\) belongs to \({\cal L}{\rm ap}_{+}(E)\) and \(\widetilde{v}(\zeta)\) equals \(g(\zeta)\) for \({\rm Re}\,\zeta>\omega\), thanks to Proposition 1.10.9(ii).

**1.10.18 Remarks** **(a)** The above proof shows that estimate (1.10.15) guarantees that the holomorphic function \(f\) is the Laplace transformation of a continuous function with support in \({\mathbb{R}}^{+}\). A characterization of Laplace transforms of functions in \(L_{\infty}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) with support in \({\mathbb{R}}^{+}\) has been given by Arendt in [Are87] (also

---

see [30, Theorem 0.2]). The standard reference for vector-valued Laplace transforms of functions and measures is [30, Chapter VI].

**(b)**: For simplicity we restricted ourselves to distributions on \(\mathbb{R}\). However, it is not difficult to verify that the proofs given in [19] or [31] for scalar Laplace transforms in \(n\) variables carry over to the case of vector-valued distributions. This is also true for vector-valued versions of the Paley-Wiener theorems characterizing Laplace transforms of test functions and distributions with compact supports.

The above proofs are adaptions of and straight-forward extensions from the scalar to the vector-valued case of the proofs given in [19], [19], and [31] (also see [15, Chapter XVI]). A convolution theorem more general than Theorem 1.10.11 is given, of course, in [19].

## 2 Dyadic Decompositions and Multiplier Theorems

This section is to a large extent of technical nature. The heart of the expounded material are the results on dyadic decompositions and Fourier multiplier theorems.

The technique of dyadic decompositions is well-known in harmonic analysis and belongs to the fundament on which one can build large parts of the theory of function spaces. Multiplier theorems are the principal tool for proving resolvent estimates for elliptic differential and pseudodifferential operators. As we know from [1], resolvent estimates belong to the cornerstones on which the theory of parabolic evolution equations rests.

### Lebesgue Spaces

In this subsection we collect some more or less well-known results on \(L_{p}\)-spaces of vector-valued functions. In particular, we consider sequence spaces where the elements of the sequences lie in Banach spaces.

#### Radon Measures

Let \(X\) be a \(\sigma\)**-compact** metrizable space, that is, \(X\) is a locally compact metrizable space that can be written as a countable union of compact sets. This is the case iff \(X\) is a locally compact separable metric space. By a positive **Radon measure**\(\mu\) on \(X\) we mean a complete \(\bar{\mathbb{R}}^{+}\)-valued measure on a \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{A}_{\mu}\) containing the Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra of \(X\), which is finite on compact sets. Then \(\mu\) is **regular**, that is,

\[\mu(A)=\inf\bigl{\{}\,\mu(O)\ ;\ O\supset A,\ O\ \text{open}\,\bigr{\}}=\sup \bigl{\{}\,\mu(K)\ ;\ K\subset A,\ K\ \text{compact}\,\bigr{\}}\]

for \(A\in\mathcal{A}_{\mu}\) (e.g., [20, Theorem 2.18]). Clearly, if \(X\) is an open or a closed subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and \(\mu\) is the (restriction of the) \(n\)-dimensional Lebesgue measure on \(X\) then \(X\) is \(\sigma\)-compact and \(\mu\) is a positive Radon measure on \(X\).

Now let \(X\) be a \(\sigma\)-compact metrizable space, \(\mu\) a positive Radon measure on \(X\), and \(E:=(E,|\cdot|)\) a Banach space. In the following, we make free use (as we already did in [1]) of the Bochner integral and refer the reader to [10], [17], or [21] for details. In particular, we recall that Pettis' theorem guarantees that a function \(u\in E^{X}\) is \(\mu\)-measurable iff it is weakly \(\mu\)-measurable and \(\mu\)-almost separably valued. In particular, every \(u\in C(X,E)\) is \(\mu\)-measurable.

For \(u\in\mathcal{L}_{1}(X,\mu,E)\) and \(A\in\mathcal{A}_{\mu}\) with \(0<\mu(A)<\infty\) we define the **average of \(u\) over \(A\)** by

\[\mathchoice{{\vbox{\hbox{$-$}}\kern-13.499794pt}}{{\vbox{\hbox{$ -$}}\kern-12.149815pt}}{{\vbox{\hbox{$-$}} \kern-9.899849pt}}{{\vbox{\hbox{$-$}}\kern-8.999863pt}}\! \int_{A}u\,d\mu:=\frac{1}{\mu(A)}\int_{A}u\,d\mu\ .\]

#### 2.1.1 Proposition

_Let \(u\in\mathcal{L}_{1}(X,\mu,E)\) and let \(S\) be a closed subset of \(E\). If \(\mathchoice{{\vbox{\hbox{$-$}}\kern-13.499794pt}}{{\vbox{\hbox{$ -$}}\kern-12.149815pt}}{{\vbox{\hbox{$-$}} \kern-9.899849pt}}{{\vbox{\hbox{$-$}}\kern-8.999863pt}}\! \int_{A}u\,d\mu\in S\) for every \(A\in\mathcal{A}_{\mu}\) with \(0<\mu(A)<\infty\) then \(u(x)\in S\) for \(\mu\)-a.e. \(x\in X\)._

---

**Proof** We can assume that \(S\neq E\). By changing \(u\) on a \(\mu\)-null set we can assume that \(u(X)\) is separable, hence that \(E\) is separable. Let \(e\in S^{c}\) be given and let \(r>0\) be so small that \(\bar{\mathbb{B}}(e,r)\cap S=\emptyset\). Let \(K=\overline{K}\subset\subset X\) and suppose that \(A:=\bigl{[}u(x)\in\mathbb{B}(e,r)\bigr{]}\cap K\) has positive measure. Then

\[\Bigl{|}\,\fint_{A}u\,d\mu-e\Bigr{|}\leq\,\fint_{A}|u-e|\,d\mu\leq r\]

which contradicts \(\fint_{A}u\,d\mu\in S\). Hence we infer from the \(\sigma\)-compactness of \(X\) that \(\mu\bigl{(}\bigl{[}u(x)\in\mathbb{B}(e,r)\bigr{]}\bigr{)}=0\). Thanks to the separability of \(E\) there exists a countable dense subset \(M\) of \(S^{c}\). Consequently, \(S^{c}\) can be written as a countable union of open balls with centers in \(M\) and rational radii. Now the assertion is obvious.

**2.1.2 Corollary**: _If \(u\in\mathcal{L}_{1}(X,\mu,E)\) and \(\int_{A}u\,d\mu=0\) for each \(A\in\mathcal{A}_{\mu}\) with finite measure then \(u=0\)\(\mu\)-a.e._

**Dual Spaces**

For \(1\leq p\leq\infty\), \(u\in L_{p}(X,\mu,E)\), and \(v\in L_{p^{\prime}}(X,\mu,E^{\prime})\) with \(p^{\prime}:=p/(p-1)\), it follows from Holder's inequality that

\[\Bigl{|}\,\int_{X}\langle v,u\rangle_{E}\,d\mu\Bigr{|}\leq\int_{X}|\langle v,u \rangle_{E}|\,d\mu\leq\int_{X}|v|_{E^{\prime}}\,|u|_{E}\,d\mu\leq\|v\|_{p^{ \prime}}\,\|u\|_{p}\enspace.\] (2.1.1)

Thus, given \(v\in L_{p^{\prime}}(X,\mu,E^{\prime})\) and putting

\[T_{v}u:=\,\int_{X}\langle v,u\rangle_{E}\,d\mu\enspace,\qquad u\in L_{p}(X,\mu ,E)\enspace,\]

we see that

\[T_{v}\in L_{p}(X,\mu,E)^{\prime}\enspace,\quad\|T_{v}\|\leq\|v\|_{p^{\prime}}\enspace,\] (2.1.2)

thanks to (2.1.1). Consequently,

\[(v\mapsto T_{v})\in\mathcal{L}\bigl{(}L_{p^{\prime}}(X,\mu,E^{\prime}),L_{p}( X,\mu,E)^{\prime}\bigr{)}\enspace.\] (2.1.3)

In fact, more is true:

**2.1.3 Proposition**: _Given \(p\in[1,\infty]\), the map \(v\mapsto T_{v}\) is a linear isometry from \(L_{p^{\prime}}(X,\mu,E^{\prime})\) into \(L_{p}(X,\mu,E)^{\prime}\)._

**Proof** Let \(p>1\) and let \(v:=\sum e^{\prime}_{j}\chi_{A_{j}}\) be a \(\mu\)-simple \(E^{\prime}\)-valued function so that the \(A_{j}\) are pair-wise disjoint. Let \(\varepsilon>0\) be given. Then there exist \(e_{j}\in E\) such that \(|e_{j}|=1\) and \(\langle e^{\prime}_{j},e_{j}\rangle\geq(1-\varepsilon)\,\bigl{|}e^{\prime}_{j}\bigr{|}\), where \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:=\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{E}\). Put

\[u:=\sum_{j}\bigl{|}e^{\prime}_{j}\bigr{|}^{p^{\prime}-1}\,e_{j}\chi_{A_{j}}\]

---

and observe that

\[\left\langle v,u\right\rangle=\sum\left|e_{j}^{\prime}\right|^{p^{\prime}-1}\left \langle e_{j}^{\prime},e_{j}\right\rangle\chi_{A_{j}}\geq(1-\varepsilon)\sum \left|e_{j}^{\prime}\right|^{p^{\prime}}\chi_{A_{j}}\ .\]

Hence

\[\int_{X}\left\langle v,u\right\rangle d\mu\geq(1-\varepsilon)\sum\left|e_{j}^{ \prime}\right|^{p^{\prime}}\mu(A_{j})=(1-\varepsilon)\left\|v\right\|_{p^{ \prime}}^{p^{\prime}}\]

and

\[\left\|u\right\|_{p}=\left(\sum\left|e_{j}^{\prime}\right|^{(p^{\prime}-1)p} \mu(A_{j})\right)^{1/p}=\left\|v\right\|_{p^{\prime}}^{p^{\prime}/p}=\left\|v \right\|_{p^{\prime}}^{p^{\prime}-1}\]

if \(p<\infty\). If \(p=\infty\) and \(v\neq 0\) then \(\left\|u\right\|_{\infty}=1\). Thus

\[T_{v}u=\int_{X}\left\langle v,u\right\rangle d\mu\geq(1-\varepsilon)\left\|v \right\|_{p^{\prime}}\left\|u\right\|_{p}\,.\]

Consequently, \(\left\|T_{v}\right\|\geq(1-\varepsilon)\left\|v\right\|_{p^{\prime}}\) and, letting \(\varepsilon\to 0\) and observing (2.1.2), we see that

\[\left\|T_{v}\right\|=\left\|v\right\|_{p^{\prime}}\] (2.1.4)

for each \(\mu\)-simple \(E^{\prime}\)-valued function \(v\) on \(X\). As the set of these functions is dense in \(L_{p^{\prime}}(X,\mu,E^{\prime})\), it follows from (2.1.3) that (2.1.4) is true for each \(v\in L_{p^{\prime}}(X,\mu,E^{\prime})\), provided \(1<p\leq\infty\).

Let \(p=1\) and \(v\in L_{\infty}(X,\mu,E^{\prime})\). Denote by \(\widetilde{v}\) an arbitrary representative of \(v\). By changing \(\widetilde{v}\) on a \(\mu\)-null set we may assume that \(\widetilde{v}(X)\) is separable. Hence \(F:=\overline{\operatorname{span}}\,\widetilde{v}(X)\) is a separable closed subspace of \(E^{\prime}\). Choose \(e^{\prime}\in F\) such that \(\left|e^{\prime}\right|>\left\|T_{v}\right\|\), let \(0<r<\left|e^{\prime}\right|-\left\|T_{v}\right\|\), and put \(B:=\left[\,\left|\widetilde{v}(x)-e^{\prime}\right|<r\right]\). Fix a positive \(\varepsilon\) strictly less than \((\left|e^{\prime}\right|-\left\|T_{v}\right\|-r)/\left|e^{\prime}\right|\) and choose \(e\in E\) with \(\left|e\right|=1\) and \(\left\langle e^{\prime},e\right\rangle>(1-\varepsilon)\left|e^{\prime}\right|\). Then

\[\left|\left\langle\widetilde{v}(x),e\right\rangle-\left|e^{\prime }\right|\right| \leq\left|\left\langle\widetilde{v}(x),e\right\rangle-\left\langle e ^{\prime},e\right\rangle\right|+\left|\left\langle e^{\prime},e\right\rangle- \left|e^{\prime}\right|\right|\leq\left|\widetilde{v}(x)-e^{\prime}\right|+ \varepsilon\left|e^{\prime}\right|\] (2.1.5) \[<\left|e^{\prime}\right|-\left\|T_{v}\right\|\]

for \(x\in B\). Observe that

\[\left|\int_{X}\left\langle\widetilde{v},e\chi_{A}\right\rangle d\mu\right|\leq \left\|T_{v}\right\|\mu(A)\ ,\qquad A\in\mathcal{A}_{\mu}\ ,\]

so that

\[\fint_{A}\left\langle\widetilde{v},e\right\rangle d\mu\in\bar{\mathbb{B}}(0, \left\|T_{v}\right\|)\]

for each \(A\in\mathcal{A}_{\mu}\) with \(0<\mu(A)<\infty\). Hence \(\left|\left\langle\widetilde{v}(x),e\right\rangle\right|\leq\left\|T_{v}\right\|\) for \(\mu\)-a.e. \(x\in X\), thanks to Proposition 2.1.1. Thus it follows from (2.1.5) that \(\mu(B)=0\). Now the separability of \(F\) implies -- similarly as in the proof of Proposition 2.1.1 -- that \(\left|\widetilde{v}(x)\right|\leq\left\|T_{v}\right\|\) for \(\mu\)-a.e. \(x\in X\). Consequently, \(\left\|v\right\|_{\infty}\leq\left\|T_{v}\right\|\) and (2.1.2) implies the assertion in this case as well.

**Definition 2.1.4**.: _Let \(\mu\) be a sequence of integers \(n\) and \(\mu\). Let \(\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{n}\) be distinct elements of \(\mu\). Then \(\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{n}\) are elements of \(\mu\)._

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

**Definition 2.1.

---

We endow \(\mathbb{Z}\) with the discrete topology and denote by \(\mathcal{H}_{0}\) the counting measure on \(\mathbb{Z}\) (the zero-dimensional Hausdorff measure). Thus, if \(A\subset\mathbb{Z}\) is finite then \(\mathcal{H}_{0}(A):=\operatorname{card}(A)\), and \(\mathcal{H}_{0}(A):=\infty\) otherwise. Then \(\mathcal{H}_{0}\) is a positive Radon measure on the \(\sigma\)-compact metrizable space \(\mathbb{Z}\). Moreover, \(C(\mathbb{Z},E)=E^{\mathbb{Z}}\).

We put

\[\ell_{p}(E):=L_{p}(\mathbb{Z},\mathcal{H}_{0},E)\ ,\qquad 1\leq p\leq\infty\ ,\]

and

\[c_{0}(E):=C_{0}(\mathbb{Z},E)\ .\]

As usual,

\[\ell_{p}:=\ell_{p}(\mathbb{K})\ ,\quad c_{0}:=c_{0}(\mathbb{K})\ ,\]

if no confusion seems possible.

More generally, let \(\boldsymbol{E}:=(E_{j})\) be a doubly infinite sequence of \(\mathbb{K}\)-Banach spaces. Then we put

\[\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E}):=\Big{(}\big{\{}\,\boldsymbol{u}:=(u_{j}):\ \mathbb{Z}\to \bigcup_{j}E_{j}\ ;\ u_{j}\in E_{j},\ \|\boldsymbol{u}\|_{\ell_{p}}<\infty\, \big{\}},\ \|\boldsymbol{\cdot}\|_{\ell_{p}}\Big{)}\]

for \(1\leq p\leq\infty\), where

\[\|\boldsymbol{\cdot}\|_{\ell_{p}}:=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\left(\sum_{j}\| u_{j}\|_{E_{j}}^{p}\right)^{1/p}\ ,&1\leq p<\infty\ ,\\ \sup_{j}\|u_{j}\|_{E_{j}}\ ,&p=\infty\ .\end{array}\right.\]

We also put

\[c_{0}(\boldsymbol{E}):=\big{\{}\,\boldsymbol{u}\in\ell_{\infty}(\boldsymbol{E} )\ ;\ \|u_{j}\|_{E_{j}}\to 0\ \text{as}\ j\to\pm\infty\,\big{\}}\ .\]

Clearly, if \(E_{j}=E\) for \(j\in\mathbb{Z}\), then

\[\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})=\ell_{p}(E)\ ,\quad 1\leq p\leq\infty\ ,\qquad c_{0}( \boldsymbol{E})=c_{0}(E)\ .\] (2.1.6)

It is an easy exercise to prove that \(\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\) is a Banach space for \(1\leq p\leq\infty\), that \(c_{0}(\boldsymbol{E})\) is a closed linear subspace of \(\ell_{\infty}(\boldsymbol{E})\), and that

\[\|\boldsymbol{u}\|_{\ell_{p_{0}}}\leq\|\boldsymbol{u}\|_{\ell_{p_{1}}}\ ,\qquad 1 \leq p_{1}\leq p_{0}\leq\infty\ ,\] (2.1.7)

so that

\[\ell_{p_{1}}(\boldsymbol{E})\hookrightarrow\ell_{p_{0}}(\boldsymbol{E})\ , \qquad 1\leq p_{1}\leq p_{0}\leq\infty\ .\] (2.1.8)

Moreover,

\[\ell_{p_{1}}(\boldsymbol{E})\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}} \ell_{p_{0}}(\boldsymbol{E})\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}c_{0 }(\boldsymbol{E})\hookrightarrow\ell_{\infty}(\boldsymbol{E})\ ,\qquad 1\leq p_{1}\leq p_{0}< \infty\ .\] (2.1.9)

Let \(\boldsymbol{E}^{\prime}:=(E^{\prime}_{j})\). Then Holder's inequality implies that

\[\langle\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{u}\rangle_{\ell_{p}}:=\sum_{j}\langle v_{j} ,u_{j}\rangle_{E_{j}}\ ,\qquad\boldsymbol{v}\in\ell_{p^{\prime}}(\boldsymbol{E}^{ \prime})\ ,\quad\boldsymbol{u}\in\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\ ,\] (2.1.10)

---

is well-defined and satisfies

\[|\langle\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{u}\rangle_{\ell_{p}}|\leq\left\|\boldsymbol{v} \right\|_{\ell_{p^{\prime}}(\boldsymbol{E}^{\prime})}\left\|\boldsymbol{u} \right\|_{\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})}\ .\] (2.1.11)

The following theorem shows that more is true:

**2.1.6 Theorem**: _With respect to the \(\ell_{p}\)-duality pairing (2.1.10)_

\[\left[\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\right]^{\prime}=\ell_{p^{\prime}}(\boldsymbol{ E}^{\prime})\ ,\qquad 1\leq p<\infty\ ,\]

_and_

\[\left[c_{0}(\boldsymbol{E})\right]^{\prime}=\ell_{1}(\boldsymbol{E}^{\prime})\ .\]

Proof.: (i) Define \(T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\) for \(\boldsymbol{v}\in\ell_{p^{\prime}}(\boldsymbol{E}^{\prime})\) by

\[T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\boldsymbol{u}:=\langle\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{u}\rangle_ {\ell_{p}}\ ,\qquad\boldsymbol{u}\in\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\ .\]

Then an obvious modification of the first part of the proof of Proposition 2.1.3 shows that \(\boldsymbol{v}\mapsto T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\) is a linear isometry from \(\ell_{p^{\prime}}(\boldsymbol{E}^{\prime})\) into \(\left[\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\right]^{\prime}\) if \(1<p\leq\infty\).

If \(p=1\) then

\[T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\in\left[\ell_{1}(\boldsymbol{E})\right]^{\prime}\quad\text {and}\quad\left\|T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\right\|\leq\left\|\boldsymbol{v}\right\|_ {\ell_{\infty}}\ ,\qquad\boldsymbol{v}\in\ell_{\infty}(\boldsymbol{E}^{\prime})\ .\]

Given \(\boldsymbol{v}\in\ell_{\infty}(\boldsymbol{E}^{\prime})\) and \(\varepsilon>0\), there exists \(k\in\mathbb{Z}\) with \(|v_{k}|_{E_{k}^{\prime}}\geq(1-\varepsilon)\left\|\boldsymbol{v}\right\|_{\ell _{\infty}}\). If \(E_{k}\neq\{0\}\) then we can find \(u_{k}\in E_{k}\) with \(|u_{k}|_{E_{k}}=1\) and

\[\langle v_{k},u_{k}\rangle_{E_{k}}\geq(1-\varepsilon)\left|v_{k}\right|_{E_{k} ^{\prime}}\geq(1-\varepsilon)^{2}\left\|\boldsymbol{v}\right\|_{\ell_{\infty} }\ .\]

Thus, letting \(\boldsymbol{u}:=(u_{k}\delta_{kj})_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}\), where \(\delta_{kj}\) is the Kronecker symbol, we see that \(\boldsymbol{u}\in\ell_{1}(\boldsymbol{E})\) with \(\left\|\boldsymbol{u}\right\|_{\ell_{1}}=1\) and

\[|T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\boldsymbol{u}|=\langle v_{k},u_{k}\rangle_{E_{k}}\geq(1- \varepsilon)^{2}\left\|\boldsymbol{v}\right\|_{\ell_{\infty}}\ .\]

This implies \(\left\|T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\right\|\geq\left\|\boldsymbol{v}\right\|_{\ell_{ \infty}}\), so that \(\boldsymbol{v}\mapsto T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\) is a linear isometry from \(\ell_{\infty}(\boldsymbol{E}^{\prime})\) into \(\left[\ell_{1}(\boldsymbol{E})\right]^{\prime}\) as well. Thus it remains to show that \(\boldsymbol{v}\mapsto T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\) is surjective.

Let \(f\in\left[\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\right]^{\prime}\) be given. For each \(k\in\mathbb{Z}\) define \(e_{k}^{\prime}\in E_{k}^{\prime}\) by

\[\langle e_{k}^{\prime},e_{k}\rangle:=f\left((e_{k}\delta_{kj})_{j\in\mathbb{N }}\right)\ ,\qquad e_{k}\in E_{k}\ .\]

Let \(\boldsymbol{v}:=(e_{j}^{\prime})\) and put \(\boldsymbol{v}^{N}:=\boldsymbol{v}\chi_{\left\lfloor\,|j|\leq N\right\rfloor}\) for \(N\in\mathbb{N}\). Then \(\boldsymbol{v}^{N}\in\ell_{p^{\prime}}(\boldsymbol{E}^{\prime})\) and

\[\langle\boldsymbol{v}^{N},\boldsymbol{u}\rangle_{\ell_{p}}=\sum_{j=-N}^{N} \langle e_{j}^{\prime},u_{j}\rangle_{E_{j}}=f(\boldsymbol{u}^{N})\ ,\qquad \boldsymbol{u}\in\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\ ,\] (2.1.12)

---

where \(\boldsymbol{u}^{N}:=\boldsymbol{u}\chi_{[\,|j|\leq N]}\). This means that

\[T_{\boldsymbol{v}^{N}}\boldsymbol{u}=f(\boldsymbol{u}^{N})\ ,\qquad\boldsymbol{u} \in\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\ .\]

From this and the first part of the proof we deduce that

\[\|\boldsymbol{v}^{N}\|_{\ell_{p^{\prime}}}=\|T_{\boldsymbol{v}^{N}}\|_{[\ell_{ p}(\boldsymbol{E})]^{\prime}}\leq\|f\|_{[\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})]^{\prime}}\ ,\qquad N\in\mathbb{N}\ .\]

It is an easy consequence of this estimate that \(\boldsymbol{v}\in\ell_{p^{\prime}}(\boldsymbol{E})\). Since \(\boldsymbol{u}^{N}\to\boldsymbol{u}\) in \(\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\) as \(N\to\infty\), thanks to \(1\leq p<\infty\), we now infer from (2.1.12) that \(\langle\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{u}\rangle_{\ell_{p}}=f(\boldsymbol{u})\) for \(\boldsymbol{u}\in\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\). This proves the surjectivity of the map \(\boldsymbol{v}\mapsto T_{\boldsymbol{v}}\).

(ii) The above proof applies to \(f\in[c_{0}(\boldsymbol{E})]^{\prime}\) as well.

The proof of Theorem 2.1.6 is a trivial extension of the corresponding result for the case where \(E_{j}=E\) for all \(j\in\mathbb{Z}\), which can be found in Lions and Peetre [26], although it was probably already known to Grothendieck much earlier. It should be noted that there are no restrictions on the Banach spaces \(E_{j}\).

Now suppose that

\[E_{j}:=\{0\}\ ,\qquad j\notin\{1,\ldots,n\}\ .\] (2.1.13)

Then

\[\|\boldsymbol{u}\|_{\infty}\leq\|\boldsymbol{u}\|_{\ell_{p}}\leq\sqrt[p]{n}\, \|u\|_{\infty}\ ,\qquad 1\leq p<\infty\ ,\] (2.1.14)

so that

\[\ell_{p}(\boldsymbol{E})\doteq c_{0}(\boldsymbol{E})\doteq\ell_{2}(\boldsymbol {E})=:E_{1}\times\cdots\times E_{n}\ ,\qquad 1\leq p\leq\infty\ .\] (2.1.15)

Note that the last definition means that we equip the product Banach space \(E_{1}\times\cdots\times E_{n}\) with the 'Euclidean norm', unless otherwise stated. If, in addition, \(E_{1}=\cdots=E_{n}=E\), then in abuse of notation

\[\ell_{p}^{(n)}(E):=(E^{n},|\cdot|_{\ell_{p}})\] (2.1.16)

and \(\ell_{p}^{(n)}:=\ell_{p}^{(n)}(\mathbb{K})\).

#### Weighted Sequence Spaces

In connection with dyadic resolutions of the identity we shall encounter the sequence spaces

\[\ell_{p}^{s}(E):=L_{p}(\mathbb{Z},\mu_{s};E)\ ,\qquad 1\leq p\leq\infty\ ,\quad s \in\mathbb{R}\ ,\] (2.1.17)

where \(\mu_{s}\) is the Radon measure on \(\mathbb{Z}\) that assigns the value \(2^{ks}\) to the singleton \(\{k\}\). Letting

\[E_{k}^{s}:=2^{ks}E:=(E,2^{ks}\,|\cdot|_{E})\doteq E\ ,\qquad k\in\mathbb{Z}\ , \quad s\in\mathbb{R}\ ,\] (2.1.18)

---

and \(\mbox{\boldmath$E$}^{s}:=(E^{s}_{k})\), it follows that

\[\ell^{s}_{p}(E)=\ell_{p}(\mbox{\boldmath$E$}^{s})\ ,\qquad 1\leq p\leq\infty\ ,\quad s \in\mathbb{R}\ .\] (2.1.19)

Observe that

\[\ell_{p}(E)=\ell^{0}_{p}(E)\ ,\qquad 1\leq p\leq\infty\ .\] (2.1.20)

We also put

\[c^{s}_{0}(E):=c_{0}(\mbox{\boldmath$E$}^{s})\ ,\]

so that \(c^{0}_{0}(E)=c_{0}(E)\).

The following theorem is an almost immediate consequence of the above duality theorem for \(\ell_{p}\) spaces.

**2.1.7 Theorem**: _With respect to the \(\ell_{p}\)-duality pairing_:

\[\left[\ell^{s}_{p}(E)\right]^{\prime}=\ell^{-s}_{p^{\prime}}(E^{\prime})\ , \qquad 1\leq p<\infty\ ,\]

_and_

\[\left[c^{s}_{0}(E)\right]^{\prime}=\ell^{-s}_{1}(E^{\prime})\]

_for \(s\in\mathbb{R}\)._

**Proof** Since \(\left(E^{s}_{k}\right)^{\prime}=\left(E^{\prime}\right)^{-s}_{k}\) with respect to the \(E^{\prime}\)-\(E\) duality pairing, Theorem 2.1.6 implies the assertion.

For later use we include a simple embedding theorem for \(\ell^{s}_{p}\)-spaces.

**2.1.8 Proposition**: _Suppose that \(s,t\in\mathbb{R}\) and \(p,q\in[1,\infty]\). Then_

\[\ell^{s}_{p}(E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}\ell^{s}_{q}(E) \stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}c^{s}_{0}(E)\hookrightarrow\ell ^{s}_{\infty}(E)\ ,\qquad p\leq q<\infty\ ,\] (2.1.21)

_and, if \(E_{k}=\{0\}\) for \(k<0\), then_

\[\ell^{s}_{p}(E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}\ell^{t}_{q}(E) \ ,\qquad s>t\ .\] (2.1.22)

_If \(E_{0}\) and \(E_{1}\) are Banach spaces with \(E_{1}\hookrightarrow E_{0}\) then_

\[\ell^{s}_{p}(E_{1})\hookrightarrow\ell^{s}_{p}(E_{0})\quad\mbox{and}\quad c^{ s}_{0}(E_{1})\hookrightarrow c^{s}_{0}(E_{0})\ .\] (2.1.23)

_If \(\left(E_{0},E_{1}\right)\) is a densely injected Banach couple then_

\[\ell^{s}_{p}(E_{1})\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}\ell^{s}_{p }(E_{0})\ \mbox{for }p<\infty\quad\mbox{and}\quad c^{s}_{0}(E_{1})\stackrel{{ d}}{{ \hookrightarrow}}c^{s}_{0}(E_{0})\ .\] (2.1.24)

**Proof** It follows from (2.1.8), (2.1.9), and (2.1.19) that the injections in (2.1.21) are well-defined and continuous. Put

\[C_{c}(\mathbb{Z},E):=\big{\{}\,u:\,\mathbb{Z}\to E\ ;\ \mbox{supp}(u)\ \mbox{is finite}\,\big{\}}\]

---

and note that

\[C_{c}(\mathbb{Z},E)\overset{d}{\subset}c_{0}^{s}(E)\ ,\qquad s\in\mathbb{R}\ .\] (2.1.25)

Since it is also easily verified that

\[C_{c}(\mathbb{Z},E)\overset{d}{\subset}\ell_{p}^{s}(E)\ ,\qquad s\in\mathbb{R}\ , \quad 1\leq p<\infty\ ,\] (2.1.26)

assertion (2.1.21) follows. If \(E_{k}=\{0\}\) for \(k<0\) then

\[\begin{split}\|\boldsymbol{u}\|_{\ell_{q}^{t}}=\big{\|}(2^{kt}u_{ k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\big{\|}_{\ell_{q}}&\leq\big{\|}(2^{k(t-s)})_{k \in\mathbb{N}}\big{\|}_{\ell_{q}}\big{\|}(2^{ks}u_{k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\big{\|} _{\ell_{\infty}}\\ &=c\,\|\boldsymbol{u}\|_{\ell_{\infty}^{s}}\leq c\,\|\boldsymbol{ u}\|_{\ell_{p}^{s}}\end{split}\] (2.1.27)

for \(\boldsymbol{u}:=(u_{k})\in\ell_{p}^{s}(E)\), where the last inequality follows from (2.1.21). Hence we see that \(\ell_{p}^{s}(E)\hookrightarrow\ell_{q}^{t}(E)\) for \(s>t\). The density assertion is now a consequence of (2.1.25) and (2.1.26).

Assertion (2.1.23) is obvious. If \(E_{1}\) is also dense in \(E_{0}\) then (2.1.24) is an easy consequence of (2.1.25) and (2.1.26),

Of course, if \(E_{k}=\{0\}\) for \(k<0\) then \(\ell_{p}(E)=L_{p}(\mathbb{N},\mathcal{H}_{0}\,,E),\ 1\leq p\leq\infty\), and \(c_{0}(E)=C_{0}(\mathbb{N},E)\), etc.

### Vector Measures and the Riesz Representation Theorem

In connection with duality theory and Besov spaces we need some explicit information on \(C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)^{\prime}\). For this reason we present in this subsection some elements of the theory of vector measures and prove a generalization of the well-known Riesz representation theorem.

#### Measures of Bounded Variation

Throughout this subsection \(E:=(E,|\cdot|)\) is a Banach space, \(X\) is a \(\sigma\)-compact metrizable space, and \(\mathcal{B}_{X}\) denotes the Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra of \(X\). By an \(E\)-valued **vector measure**\(\mu\) on \(X\) we mean a \(\sigma\)-additive map \(\mu:\ \mathcal{B}_{X}\to E\) satisfying \(\mu(\emptyset)=0\). For such a vector measure \(\mu\) we define the **variation**\(|\mu|:\ \mathcal{B}_{X}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}\cup\{\infty\}\) by

\[|\mu|\,(B):=\sup_{\pi(B)}\sum_{A\in\pi(B)}|\mu(A)|\ ,\qquad B\in\mathcal{B}_{X}\ ,\]

where the supremum is taken over all partitions \(\pi(B)\) of \(B\) into a finite number of pair-wise disjoint Borel subsets. Then \(\mu\) is said to be of **bounded variation** if

\[\|\mu\|_{BV}:=|\mu|\,(X)<\infty\ .\]

---

The set of all \(E\)-valued vector measures on \(X\) of bounded variation is denoted by

\[{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E):=\left({\cal M}_{BV}(X,E),\;\|\!\cdot\!\|_{BV}\right)\ .\]

It is clear that \({\cal M}_{BV}(X,E)\) is a normed vector space with the obvious linear structure (as a vector subspace of \(E^{{\cal B}_{X}}\)).

Given \(\mu\in{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E)\), it follows from \(|\mu(B)|\leq|\mu|\,(B)\) for \(B\in{\cal B}_{X}\) that \(|\mu|\) is a positive Borel measure on \(X\). We denote its completion, defined on the \(\sigma\)-algebra \({\cal A}_{|\mu|}\), consisting of all \(A\subset X\) of the form \(A=B\cup N\) where \(B\in{\cal B}_{X}\) and \(N\) is a subset of a \(|\mu|\)-null set, again by \(|\mu|\). Then \(|\mu|\) is a positive finite Radon measure on \(X\).

**2.2.1 Remark** Denote by \(dx\) a positive Radon measure on \(X\). Then, given any function \(u\in L_{1}(X,dx,E)\),

\[(u\,dx)(B):=\int_{B}u\,dx\ ,\qquad B\in{\cal B}_{X}\ ,\]

defines an \(E\)-valued measure of bounded variation and \(\|u\,dx\|_{BV}=\|u\|_{1}\) (cf. [DU77, Theorem 4(iv) on p. 46] or [Lan69, Theorem XI.9]). Hence

\[(u\mapsto u\,dx):\;L_{1}(X,dx,E)\to{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E)\]

is a linear isometry. Occasionally, it will be convenient to identify \(u\) with \(u\,dx\), that is, to consider \(L_{1}(X,dx,E)\) as a closed linear subspace of \({\cal M}_{BV}(X,E)\).

**Integrals with Respect to Vector Measures**

Let \(E_{0}\), \(E_{1}\), and \(E_{2}\) be Banach spaces and suppose that

\[E_{1}\times E_{2}\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(e_{1},e_{2})\mapsto e_{1}\bullet e_{2}\]

is a multiplication. Let \({\cal B}(X,E_{1})\) be the closure in \(B(X,E_{1})\) of the linear subspace \(S(X,E_{1})\) of all simple functions

\[u=\sum_{B\in\pi}\chi_{B}\otimes e_{B}\ ,\qquad e_{B}\in E_{1}\ ,\quad\pi:=\pi(X)\ .\]

If \(u\in S(X,E_{1})\) is given by (2.2.2) and \(\mu\in{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{2})\) then we put

\[\int u\,d\mu:=\int_{X}u\,d\mu:=\sum_{B\in\pi}e_{B}\bullet\mu(B)\in E_{0}\ .\]

It follows that

\[S(X,E_{1})\times{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{2})\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(u,\mu)\mapsto\int u\,d\mu\]

---

is a well-defined bilinear map satisfying

\[\Big{|}\int u\,d\mu\Big{|}_{E_{0}}\leq\sum_{B\in\pi}|e_{B}|\,|\mu(B)|\leq\sum_{B\in \pi}|e_{B}|\,|\mu|\,(B)\leq\|u\|_{\infty}\,\|\mu\|_{BV}\ \ .\] (2.2.3)

Hence it possesses a unique continuous bilinear extension of norm at most one over \({\cal B}(X,E_{1})\times{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{2})\). Note that \(C_{0}(X,E_{1})\) is a closed linear subspace of \({\cal B}(X,E_{1})\). Thus, by restriction, we obtain a well-defined multiplication

\[C_{0}(X,E_{1})\times{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{2})\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(u,\mu)\mapsto\int u \,d\mu:=\int_{X}u\,d\mu\] (2.2.4)

and \(\int_{X}u\,d\mu\) is said to be the **integral of \(u\) over \(X\) with respect to \(\mu\)** (and the multiplication (2.2.1)). In fact, from (2.2.3) we deduce that

\[\Big{|}\int u\,d\mu\Big{|}_{E_{0}}\leq\int|u|\,d\,|\mu|\leq\|u\|_{\infty}\,\| \mu\|_{BV}\] (2.2.5)

for \(u\in C_{0}(X,E_{1})\) and \(\mu\in{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{2})\).

Now suppose that there are further Banach spaces \(E_{3}\), \(E_{4}\), and \(E_{5}\), and multiplications satisfying the associativity assumption of Remark 1.6.5(e). Then it follows from the definition of \(\int u\,d\mu\) that, for each \(u\) of the form (2.2.2),

\[\int u\,d\mu\bullet e=\sum_{B\in\pi}e_{B}\bullet\big{(}\mu(B)\bullet e\big{)} \in E_{5}\ ,\qquad e\in E_{3}\ .\] (2.2.6)

Note that, given \(e\in E_{3}\),

\[\mu\bullet e:=\mu(\cdot)\bullet e:\,{\cal B}_{X}\to E_{4}\ ,\quad B\mapsto\mu(B) \bullet e\]

is \(\sigma\)-additive. Moreover,

\[|\mu\bullet e(B)|\leq|\mu(B)|\,|e|\leq|\mu|\,(B)\,|e|\ ,\qquad B\in{\cal B}_{X}\ ,\]

plainly implies that \(\mu\bullet e\) is an \(E_{4}\)-valued vector measure on \(X\) of bounded variation, and that

\[{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{2})\times E_{3}\to{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{4})\ ,\quad(\mu,e) \mapsto\mu\bullet e\] (2.2.7)

is a multiplication. From this and (2.2.6) we infer that

\[\Big{(}\int u\,d\mu\Big{)}\bullet e=\int u\,d(\mu\bullet e)\] (2.2.8)

and that

\[C_{0}(X,E_{1})\times{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{2})\times E_{3}\to E_{5}\ ,\quad(u,\mu,e) \mapsto\int u\,d(\mu\bullet e)\] (2.2.9)

is a trilinear multiplication.

---

Similarly as above, we see that (2.2.1) induces a multiplication

\[E_{1}\times{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{2})\to{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{0})\ ,\quad(e,\mu)\mapsto e \bullet\mu\ .\] (2.2.10)

Thus, given

\[\varphi=\sum_{B\in\pi}\alpha_{B}\chi_{B}\in S(X,{\mathbb{K}})\ ,\]

it follows from

\[\varphi\otimes e=\sum_{B\in\pi}\alpha_{B}\chi_{B}\otimes e=\sum_{B\in\pi}\chi_{ B}\otimes(\alpha_{B}e)\in S(X,E_{1})\]

for \(e\in E_{1}\) that

\[\int\varphi\otimes e\,d\mu=\sum_{B\in\pi}\alpha_{B}e\bullet\mu(B)=\int\varphi\, d(e\bullet\mu)\ .\]

From this we deduce that

\[\int\varphi\otimes e\,d\mu=\int\varphi\,d(e\bullet\mu)\ ,\qquad\varphi\otimes e \in C_{0}(X)\otimes E_{1}\ ,\quad\mu\in{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E_{2})\ .\] (2.2.11)

In the following, we leave it to the reader to identify the choices for the spaces \(E_{0},\ldots,E_{5}\) and the multiplications that we are using in concrete situations.

#### Vector Measures as Distributions

Now suppose that \(X\) is open in \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) . Since \({\cal D}(X)\) is dense in \(C_{0}(X)\), it follows that the multiplication

\[C_{0}(X)\times{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E)\to E\ ,\quad(\varphi,\mu)\mapsto\int\varphi\,d\mu\]

is completely determined by its restriction to \({\cal D}(X)\times{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E)\). Put

\[T_{\mu}\varphi:=\int\varphi\,d\mu\ ,\qquad(\varphi,\mu)\in{\cal D}(X)\times{ \cal M}_{BV}(X,E)\ .\]

Then \({\cal D}(X)\hookrightarrow C_{0}(X)\) implies

\[(\mu\mapsto T_{\mu})\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E),{\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E )\bigr{)}\ .\] (2.2.12)

Suppose that \(T_{\mu}=0\) in \({\cal D}^{\prime}(X,E)\) for some \(\mu\in{\cal M}_{BV}(X,E)\). Then we infer from (2.2.8) that

\[\langle e^{\prime},T_{\mu}\varphi\rangle_{E}=\int\varphi\,d\langle e^{\prime}, \mu\rangle_{E}=0\ ,\qquad\varphi\in{\cal D}(X)\ ,\quad e^{\prime}\in E^{\prime}\ .\]

Since \(\langle e^{\prime},\mu\rangle_{E}\in{\cal M}_{BV}(X):={\cal M}_{BV}(X,{\mathbb{ K}})\) , this implies \(\langle e^{\prime},\mu\rangle_{E}=0\) for each \(e^{\prime}\in E^{\prime}\). Thus \(\bigl{\langle}e^{\prime},\mu(B)\bigr{\rangle}_{E}=0\) for \(e^{\prime}\in E^{\prime}\) and \(B\in{\cal B}_{X}\), which gives \(\mu=0\). This shows that (2.2.12) is an injection. Thus the following convention is justified.

---

Convention Let \(X\) be a nonempty open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\). Then we identify \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{BV}(X,E)\) with \(T_{\mu}\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X,E)\) so that

\[\mathcal{M}_{BV}(X,E)\hookrightarrow\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(X,E)\] (2.2.13)

and

\[\mu(\varphi)=\int_{X}\varphi\,d\mu\ ,\qquad\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{BV}(X,E)\ ,\quad \varphi\in\mathcal{D}(X)\ .\] (2.2.14)

**Convolutions Involving Vector Measures**

Observe that \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}C_{0} (\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\) implies

\[\mathcal{M}_{BV}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\hookrightarrow\mathcal{S}^{\prime}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ .\] (2.2.15)

Hence we know from Proposition 1.2.7 that the convolution product \(\varphi*\mu\) is a well-defined element of \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\) and \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{BV}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\). Moreover,

\[(\varphi*\mu)(x)=\mu(\tau_{x}\dot{\varphi})=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\varphi(x-y) \,d\mu(y)\ ,\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\] (2.2.16)

for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\) and \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{BV}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\). Hence, by (2.2.5),

\[|\varphi*\mu(x)|_{E}\leq\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|\varphi(x-y)|\,d\,|\mu|\,(y)=| \varphi|*|\mu|\,(x)\ ,\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\]

so that, by Fubini's theorem,

\[\|\varphi*\mu\|_{1}\leq\|\varphi\|_{1}\,\|\mu\|_{BV}\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{ S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\ ,\quad\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{BV}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ .\] (2.2.17)

**2.2.2 Proposition** _Convolution is a well-defined multiplication_:

\[L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\times\mathcal{M}_{BV}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\to L_{1}( \mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\ .\]

**Proof** This follows from (2.2.17) by continuous extension.

If \(E=\mathbb{K}\) then, thanks to Remark 2.2.1, Proposition 2.2.2 reduces to the well-known fact that \(L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\) is an ideal in the convolution algebra of all \(\mathbb{K}\)-valued Borel measures (e.g., [Pet83, Theorem I.4.5]).

**2.2.3 Lemma** _Suppose \(\varphi\in L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\), \(u\in C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\), and \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{BV}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E^{\prime})\). Then_

\[\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\varphi*u\,d\mu=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}u\,d(\dot{\varphi}* \mu)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\langle\dot{\varphi}*\mu,u\rangle_{E}\,dx=\langle \dot{\varphi}*\mu,u\rangle\ .\] (2.2.18)

---

ProofFrom Theorem 1.9.9, Remark 2.2.1, Proposition 2.2.2, and (2.2.4) we infer that each one of the maps that send

\[(\varphi,u,\mu)\in L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\times C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\times \mathcal{M}_{BV}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E^{\prime})\]

into one of the integrals in (2.2.18) is a trilinear \(\mathbb{K}\)-valued multiplication. Thus, since \(C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\otimes E\) is dense in \(C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) by Theorem 1.3.6(x), it suffices to consider the case where \(u=\psi\otimes e\in C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\otimes E\). Since \(\varphi*(\psi\otimes e)=(\varphi*\psi)\otimes e\) we deduce from (2.2.11), (2.2.16), and Fubini's theorem that

\[\begin{split}\int\varphi*u\,d\mu&=\int\varphi*\psi \,d\langle\mu,e\rangle_{E}=\iint\varphi(x-y)\,d\langle\mu,e\rangle_{E}(x)\psi( y)\,dy\\ &=\int(\check{\varphi}*\langle\mu,e\rangle_{E})\psi\,dx\ .\end{split}\] (2.2.19)

Moreover, thanks to (2.2.8),

\[\begin{split}\check{\varphi}*\langle\mu,e\rangle_{E}(x)& =\int\check{\varphi}(x-y)\,d\langle\mu,e\rangle_{E}(y)=\Big{\langle}\int \check{\varphi}(x-y)\,d\mu(y),e\Big{\rangle}_{E}\\ &=\big{\langle}\check{\varphi}*\mu(x),e\big{\rangle}_{E}\ ,\end{split}\]

so that the last integral in (2.2.19) equals

\[\int\langle\check{\varphi}*\mu(x),\psi(x)\otimes e\big{\rangle}_{E}\,dx=\int \langle\check{\varphi}*\mu,u\rangle_{E}\,dx=\langle\check{\varphi}*\mu,u \rangle\ .\]

This proves the lemma.

#### The Riesz Representation Theorem

Finally, we prove a generalization of the classical (scalar) Riesz Representation Theorem.

**2.2.4 Theorem**: _Let \(X\) be a \(\sigma\)-compact metrizable space and let \(E\) be a Banach space. Then_

\[C_{0}(X,E)^{\prime}=\mathcal{M}_{BV}(X,E^{\prime})\]

_with respect to the duality pairing_

\[\langle\mu,u\rangle_{C_{0}}:=\int_{X}u\,d\mu\ ,\qquad\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{BV}(X,E ^{\prime})\ ,\quad u\in C_{0}(X,E)\ .\]

ProofSuppose that \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{BV}(X,E^{\prime})\). Then it follows from (2.2.4) that

\[\big{(}u\mapsto\int u\,d\mu\big{)}\in C_{0}(X,E)^{\prime}\]

---

and

\[\Big{|}\int u\,d\mu\Big{|}\leq\|\mu\|_{BV}\,\|u\|_{\infty}\ \ ,\qquad u\in C_{0}(X,E)\ .\] (2.2.20)

Conversely, let \(w\in C_{0}(X,E)^{\prime}\) be fixed. Then, given any \(e\in E\), the scalar Riesz representation theorem (e.g., [13, Theorems 2.14, 6.2, and 6.19]) implies the existence of a unique regular \(\mathbb{K}\)-valued Radon measure \(\mu_{e}\) on \(X\) satisfying

\[w(\varphi\otimes e)=\int\varphi\,d\mu_{e}\ ,\qquad\varphi\in C_{0}(X)\ ,\] (2.2.21)

and

\[\|\mu_{e}\|_{BV}=\sup_{\|\varphi\|_{\infty}\leq 1}\Big{|}\int\varphi\,d\mu_{e} \Big{|}=\sup_{\|\varphi\|_{\infty}\leq 1}|w(\varphi\otimes e)|\leq\|w\|_{C_{0}^{ \prime}}\,|e|_{E}\ \ .\]

Since, by uniqueness, the map \(E\to(\Cal{B}_{X}\to\mathbb{K})\), \(e\mapsto\mu_{e}\) is linear, it follows that

\[\big{\langle}\mu(B),e\big{\rangle}:=\mu_{e}(B)\ ,\qquad B\in\Cal{B}_{X}\ ,\] (2.2.22)

defines a map \(\mu:\,\Cal{B}_{X}\to E^{\prime}\) that is easily seen to be finitely additive.

In order to show that \(\mu\) has bounded variation we first consider a family \(\{\Cal{O}_{1},\ldots,\Cal{O}_{m}\}\) of pair-wise disjoint open subsets of \(X\). For each \(j\in\{1,\ldots,m\}\) we choose \(\varphi_{j}\in C_{0}(X)\) with \(\operatorname{supp}(\varphi_{j})\subset\Cal{O}_{j}\) and \(\|\varphi_{j}\|_{\infty}\leq 1\), as well as \(e_{j}\in\mathbb{B}_{E}\). Then, putting

\[\varepsilon_{j}:=\operatorname{sign}w(\varphi_{j}\otimes e_{j})\in\mathbb{K}\]

and using (2.2.21),

\[\eqalign{\sum_{j=1}^{m}\Bigl{|}\int_{\Cal{O}_{j}}\varphi_{j}\,d\mu_{e_{j}} \Bigr{|}&=\sum_{j=1}^{m}|w(\varphi_{j}\otimes e_{j})|=\sum_{j=1}^{m} \varepsilon_{j}w(\varphi_{j}\otimes e_{j})\cr&=w\Bigl{(}\sum_{j=1}^{m}\varphi_ {j}\otimes\varepsilon_{j}e_{j}\Bigr{)}\leq\|w\|_{C_{0}^{\prime}}\ .}\]

Consequently,

\[\sum_{j=1}^{m}\big{|}\mu_{e_{j}}\big{|}\,(\Cal{O}_{j})\leq\|w\|_{C_{0}^{\prime }}\ ,\qquad e_{j}\in\mathbb{B}_{E}\ ,\quad 1\leq j\leq m\ .\] (2.2.23)

Now let \(\pi:=\{B_{1},\ldots,B_{m}\}\) be an arbitrary partition of \(X\) into Borel sets. Then, given \(\varepsilon>0\), we find for each \(j\in\{1,\ldots,m\}\) an element \(e_{j}\in\mathbb{B}_{E}\) such that

\[|\mu(B_{j})|_{E^{\prime}}\leq\big{|}\big{\langle}\mu(B_{j}),e_{j}\big{\rangle} _{E}\big{|}+\varepsilon/m\ .\] (2.2.24)

The regularity of \(\mu_{e_{j}}\) implies the existence of a compact subset \(K_{j}\) of \(B_{j}\) with

\[\big{|}\mu_{e_{j}}\big{|}\,(B_{j})\leq\big{|}\mu_{e_{j}}\big{|}\,(K_{j})+ \varepsilon/m\ .\] (2.2.25)

---

Since \(K_{j}\cap K_{k}=\emptyset\) for \(j\neq k\) we find pair-wise disjoint open sets \({\cal O}_{1},\ldots,{\cal O}_{m}\) in \(X\) such that \(K_{j}\subset{\cal O}_{j}\) for \(1\leq j\leq m\). Now we infer from (2.2.23)-(2.2.25) that

\[\sum_{j=1}^{m}|\mu(B_{j})|_{E^{\prime}} \leq\sum_{j=1}^{m}\bigl{|}\bigl{\langle}\mu(B_{j}),e_{j}\bigr{\rangle} _{E}\bigr{|}+\varepsilon\leq\sum_{j=1}^{m}\bigl{|}\mu_{e_{j}}\bigr{|}\,(B_{j})+\varepsilon\] \[\leq\sum_{j=1}^{m}\bigl{|}\mu_{e_{j}}\bigr{|}\,(K_{j})+2\varepsilon \leq\sum_{j=1}^{m}\bigl{|}\mu_{e_{j}}\bigr{|}\,({\cal O}_{j})+2\varepsilon\leq \|w\|_{C^{\prime}_{0}}+2\varepsilon\ .\]

Hence \(\mu\) is of bounded variation.

Let now \((B_{j})\) be a sequence in \({\cal B}_{X}\) such that \(B_{j}\cap B_{k}=\emptyset\) for \(j\neq k\), and put \(B:=\bigcup B_{j}\). Then it is clear that

\[\sum_{j}|\mu(B_{j})|\leq\|\mu\|_{BV}<\infty\ .\]

Thus \(\bigl{\langle}\sum_{j}\mu(B_{j}),e\bigr{\rangle}_{E}\) is well-defined for \(e\in E\) and

\[\Bigl{\langle}\sum_{j}\mu(B_{j}),e\Bigr{\rangle}_{E}=\sum_{j}\bigl{\langle}\mu( B_{j}),e\bigr{\rangle}=\sum_{j}\mu_{e}(B_{j})=\mu_{e}(B)=\bigl{\langle}\mu(B),e \bigr{\rangle}\] (2.2.26)

by the \(\sigma\)-additivity of \(\mu_{e}\). Since (2.2.26) is true for every \(e\in E\), and \(E\) separates the points of \(E^{\prime}\), it follows that \(\mu(B)=\sum_{j}\mu(B_{j})\). Now (2.2.11), (2.2.21), (2.2.22), and the density of \(C_{0}(X)\otimes E\) in \(C_{0}(X,E)\) imply

\[\langle w,u\rangle_{C_{0}}=\int u\,d\mu\ ,\qquad u\in C_{0}(X,E)\ .\]

From this and (2.2.20) the assertion follows.

The above proof of the generalized Riesz representation theorem is due to W. Arendt (personal communication).

### Dyadic Decompositions

Dyadic decompositions are locally finite partitions of unity on \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) enjoying particularly 'nice' properties. They are used in the Fourier image of tempered distributions and give a convenient and easy way to control decay properties of Fourier transforms, hence regularity properties of the original distributions. These properties are the basis for introducing the important scales of Besov spaces and for their study.

---

**Elementary Properties of the Fourier Transform**

For the reader's convenience, and for later use, we begin by recalling and extending some of the basic properties of the Fourier transform.

Let \(E\) be a Banach space. Recall that

\[{\cal F}\in{\cal L}{\rm aut}\big{(}{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)}\cap{\cal L }{\rm aut}\big{(}{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)}\] (2.3.1)

and that

\[{\cal F}^{-1}u=(2\pi)^{-n}\,\tilde{\!\tilde{u}}=(2\pi)^{-n}\,\widehat{\!\widehat {u}}\ ,\qquad u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ .\] (2.3.2)

Moreover,

\[\widehat{D^{\alpha}u}=\xi^{\alpha}\widehat{u}\ ,\qquad\alpha\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n} \ ,\quad u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ .\] (2.3.3)

By replacing \(u\) by \({\cal F}^{-1}u\) in (2.3.3) we see that \(D^{\alpha}({\cal F}^{-1}u)={\cal F}^{-1}(\xi^{\alpha}u)\). Thus (2.3.2) implies \(D^{\alpha}\,\widehat{\!\widehat{u}}=\big{(}\widehat{\xi^{\alpha}u}\big{)}\,\tilde {\!\tilde{u}}\,\). Since reflection is its own inverse and

\[D^{\alpha}\widehat{u}=(-1)^{|\alpha|}(D^{\alpha}u)\,\tilde{\!\tilde{u}}\ , \qquad u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ ,\quad\alpha\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\ ,\] (2.3.4)

it follows that

\[\widehat{\xi^{\alpha}u}=(-1)^{|\alpha|}D^{\alpha}\widehat{u}\ ,\qquad\quad u\in{ \cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ ,\quad\alpha\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\ .\] (2.3.5)

We define the dilation \(\sigma_{t}u\) by \(t>0\) of \(u\in E^{({\mathbb{R}}^{n})}\) by3

Footnote 3: Now we prefer to use definitions (2.3.6) and (2.3.7) instead of [1, (III.4.2.7) and (III.4.2.8)], respectively. This is, of course, simply a matter of convenience.

\[\sigma_{t}u(x):=u(x/t)\ ,\qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ ,\] (2.3.6)

and by

\[\sigma_{t}u(\varphi):=t^{n}u(\sigma_{t^{-1}}\varphi)\ ,\qquad u\in{\cal D}^{ \prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ ,\quad\varphi\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\ .\] (2.3.7)

Then \(\{\,\sigma_{t}\ ;\ t>0\,\}\), the group of dilations, is strongly continuous on \({\mathfrak{F}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), where \({\mathfrak{F}}\in\{{\cal D},{\cal D}^{\prime},{\cal E},{\cal E}^{\prime},{\cal S },{\cal S}^{\prime}\}\), and

\[\sigma_{t}^{-1}=\sigma_{1/t}=\sigma_{t^{-1}}\ ,\qquad t>0\ .\] (2.3.8)

It is easily verified that \({\cal F}\sigma_{t}u=t^{n}\sigma_{t^{-1}}{\cal F}u\) for \(u\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and, thanks to (2.3.7), that this is true for \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) as well, that is,

\[{\cal F}\sigma_{t}=t^{n}\sigma_{t^{-1}}{\cal F}\ ,\qquad\quad t>0\ .\] (2.3.9)

From this, (2.3.1), and (2.3.8) we infer that

\[{\cal F}^{-1}\sigma_{t}=t^{n}\sigma_{t^{-1}}{\cal F}^{-1}\ ,\qquad t>0\ .\] (2.3.10)

---

The chain rule implies \(\partial^{\alpha}(\sigma_{t}u)=t^{-|\,\alpha|}\sigma_{t}(\partial^{\alpha}u)\) for \(u\in{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\). Now we infer from (2.3.7) that this formula remains valid for \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), that is,

\[\partial^{\alpha}\sigma_{t}=t^{-|\,\alpha|}\sigma_{t}\partial^{\alpha}\ ,\qquad t>0\ ,\quad\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\ .\] (2.3.11)

Lastly, it is easily verified that \(L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) is invariant under \(\{\,\sigma_{t}\ ;\ t>0\,\}\) for \(1\leq p\leq\infty\) and that

\[\left\|\sigma_{t}u\right\|_{p}=t^{n/p}\left\|u\right\|_{p}\ ,\qquad u\in L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\quad 1\leq p\leq\infty\ ,\quad t>0\ .\] (2.3.12)

#### Dyadic Resolutions of the Identity

Now we introduce the concept of dyadic decompositions. For this we fix a function satisfying the following conditions:

\[\psi\in{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ ,\quad\psi|\,\mathbb{B}^{n}=1\ ,\quad\mbox{supp}(\psi)\subset 2\mathbb{B}^{n}=:\Omega_{0}\ .\] (2.3.13)

Then we put \(\widetilde{\psi}:=\psi-\sigma_{2^{-1}}\psi=\psi-\psi(2\cdot\,)\) and

\[\psi_{0}:=\psi\ ,\quad\psi_{k}:=\sigma_{2^{k}}\widetilde{\psi}=\psi(2^{-k} \cdot\,)-\psi(2^{-k+1}\cdot\,)\ ,\qquad k\in\lx@overaccentset{{ \bullet}}{\mathbb{N}}\ ,\] (2.3.14)

and

\[\eta_{j}:=\sigma_{2^{j}}\widetilde{\psi}=\psi(2^{-j}\cdot\,)-\psi(2^{-j+1} \cdot\,)\ ,\qquad j\in\mathbb{Z}\ .\] (2.3.15)

We also let

\[\Omega_{k}:=[2^{k-1}\leq|\xi|\leq 2^{k+1}]\ ,\qquad k\in\lx@overaccentset{{\bullet}}{\mathbb{N}}\ ,\] (2.3.16)

and

\[\Sigma_{j}:=[2^{j-1}\leq|\xi|\leq 2^{j+1}]\ ,\qquad j\in\mathbb{Z}\ .\] (2.3.17)

Then it follows that

\[\psi_{k},\eta_{j}\in{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ ,\quad\mbox{supp}(\psi_{k})\subset\Omega_{k}\ ,\quad\mbox{supp}(\eta_{j})\subset\Sigma_{j}\] (2.3.18)

for \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) and \(j\in\mathbb{Z}\). Moreover,

\[\sum_{k=0}^{m}\psi_{k}(\xi)=\psi(2^{-m}\xi)\ ,\qquad\xi\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\quad m\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\] (2.3.19)

and

\[\sum_{j=-m^{\prime}}^{m}\eta_{j}(\xi)=\psi(2^{-m}\xi)-\psi(2^{m^{\prime}+1}\xi )\ ,\qquad\xi\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\quad m,m^{\prime}\in\mathbb{N}\ .\] (2.3.20)

Consequently,

\[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\psi_{k}(\xi)=1\ ,\qquad\xi\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\] (2.3.21)

---

and

\[\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\eta_{j}(\xi)=1\ ,\qquad\xi\in(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{*}\ ,\] (2.3.22)

where for each \(\xi\in(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{*}\) at most two terms in the above series are different from zero. Thus \((\psi_{k}):=(\psi_{k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\) and \((\eta_{j}):=(\eta_{j})_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}\) are resolutions of the identity on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and on \((\mathbb{R}^{n})^{*}\), respectively, the **dyadic resolutions of the identity on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and on \((\mathbb{R}^{n})^{*}\)**, respectively, **induced by \(\psi\)**.

#### Basic Properties

Letting \(\psi_{-1}:=0\), put

\[\chi_{k}:=\psi_{k-1}+\psi_{k}+\psi_{k+1}\ ,\quad\lambda_{j}:=\eta_{j-1}+\eta_{ j}+\eta_{j+1}\ ,\qquad k\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\quad j\in\mathbb{Z}\ .\] (2.3.23)

Then it is an easy consequence of (2.3.11) and (2.3.13)-(2.3.18) that

\[\psi_{k}=\psi_{k}\chi_{k}\ ,\quad\eta_{j}=\eta_{j}\lambda_{j}\ ,\qquad k\in \mathbb{N}\ ,\quad j\in\mathbb{Z}\ ,\] (2.3.24)

and

\[2^{k|\alpha|}\,|\partial^{\alpha}\psi_{k}|\leq c(\alpha,\psi)\chi_{\Omega_{k}} \ ,\qquad k\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\quad\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\ ,\] (2.3.25)

as well as

\[2^{j|\alpha|}\,|\partial^{\alpha}\eta_{j}|\leq c(\alpha,\psi)\chi_{\Sigma_{j}} \ ,\qquad j\in\mathbb{Z}\ ,\quad\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\ .\] (2.3.26)

Since \(\psi_{k},\eta_{j}\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) it follows from the Convolution Theorem 1.9.10 and from (1.9.3) that

\[\psi_{k}(D),\eta_{j}(D)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n },E),\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad k\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\quad j\in \mathbb{Z}\ .\] (2.3.27)

We also infer from (2.3.10) that

\[\mathcal{F}^{-1}\psi_{k}=2^{kn}\sigma_{2^{-k}}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\widetilde{\psi }\ ,\quad\mathcal{F}^{-1}\eta_{j}=2^{jn}\sigma_{2^{-j}}\mathcal{F}^{-1} \widetilde{\psi}\ ,\ \ \ \ k\in\lx@overaccentset{{\star}}{\mathbb{N}}\ ,\quad j\in \mathbb{Z}\ .\] (2.3.28)

Similarly, given \(u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(k\in\lx@overaccentset{{\star}}{\mathbb{N}}\),

\[\psi_{k}(D)u=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\psi_{k}\mathcal{F}u=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\sigma_{2^{ k}}(\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2^{-k}}\mathcal{F}u)=\sigma_{2^{-k}}\mathcal{F}^{-1} \widetilde{\psi}\mathcal{F}\sigma_{2^{k}}u\ .\]

Consequently,

\[\psi_{k}(D)=\sigma_{2^{-k}}\widetilde{\psi}(D)\sigma_{2^{k}}\ ,\quad\eta_{j}(D)= \sigma_{2^{-j}}\widetilde{\psi}(D)\sigma_{2^{j}}\ ,\qquad k\in\lx@overaccentset{{\star}}{\mathbb{N}}\ ,\quad j\in\mathbb{Z}\ .\] (2.3.29)

Since \(\int u\,dx=\widehat{u}(0)\) for \(u\in L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), it follows that

\[\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\psi\,dx=1\ ,\quad\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} \mathcal{F}^{-1}\psi_{k}\,dx=0\ ,\quad\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\mathcal{F}^{-1} \eta_{j}\,dx=0\] (2.3.30)

for \(k\in\lx@overaccentset{{\star}}{\mathbb{N}}\) and \(j\in\mathbb{Z}\). Thus, letting \(\varphi_{1}:=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\psi\) and

\[\varphi_{\varepsilon}:=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\sigma_{\varepsilon^{-1}}\psi= \varepsilon^{-n}\sigma_{\varepsilon}\varphi_{1}=\varepsilon^{-n}\varphi_{1}( \varepsilon^{-1}\cdot\,)\qquad\varepsilon>0\ ,\] (2.3.31)

we see that \(\{\,\varphi_{\varepsilon}\ ;\ \varepsilon>0\,\}\) is an approximate identity.

---

Given any \(\varphi\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) and \(\alpha\in{\mathbb{N}}^{n}\),

\[\|\varphi\partial^{\alpha}(\sigma_{2^{m}}\psi-{\bf 1})\|_{\infty}\to 0\qquad{\rm as }\ m\to\infty\ .\] (2.3.32)

Consequently, \(\sigma_{2^{m}}\psi\to{\bf 1}\) in \({\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) as \(m\to\infty\), so that (2.3.19) implies

\[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\psi_{k}={\bf 1}\qquad{\rm in}\ {\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n })\ .\] (2.3.33)

Thus, given \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), it follows from Theorem 1.6.4 that \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\psi_{k}\widehat{u}=\widehat{u}\) in \({\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\). Hence we obtain from (2.3.1) that

\[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\psi_{k}(D)u=u\quad{\rm in}\ {\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^ {n},E)\ ,\qquad u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ ,\] (2.3.34)

that is,

\[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\psi_{k}(D)=1_{{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)}\qquad {\rm in}\ {\cal L}_{s}\big{(}{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)}\ .\] (2.3.35)

This shows that the dyadic resolution of the identity on \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) induced by \(\psi\) gives a **dyadic decomposition**

\[u=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}u_{k}\quad{\rm in}\ {\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ , \qquad u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ ,\] (2.3.36)

into smooth functions

\[u_{k}:=\psi_{k}(D)u\in{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ ,\qquad k\in{\mathbb{N}}\ .\] (2.3.37)

Although (2.3.22) is true, it is not true that \(\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\eta_{j}={\bf 1}\) in \({\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\). This follows from the fact that \(\sigma_{2^{-m}}\psi\) does not converge to zero in \({\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) as \(m\to\infty\). Consequently, a relation analogous to (2.3.34), namely

\[\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\eta_{j}(D)u=u\qquad{\rm in}\ {\cal S}^{\prime}({ \mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ ,\] (2.3.38)

_does not hold for all \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\)._ On the other hand, for each \(\varphi\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) it is obvious that \(\langle\sigma_{2^{-m}}\psi,\varphi\rangle\to 0\) as \(m\to\infty\). Thus the Banach-Steinhaus theorem and the fact that \({\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) is a Montel space imply that \(\sigma_{2^{-m}}\psi\to 0\) in \({\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) as \(m\to\infty\). Together with \(\sigma_{2^{m}}\psi\to{\bf 1}\) in \({\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\hookrightarrow{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) as \(m\to\infty\), this entails, thanks to (2.3.20),

\[\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\eta_{j}={\bf 1}\qquad{\rm in}\ {\cal S}^{\prime}({ \mathbb{R}}^{n})\ .\] (2.3.39)

Now we deduce from Theorem 1.6.4 that

\[\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\eta_{j}u=u\quad\text{in }\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^ {n},E)\ ,\qquad u\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ .\] (2.3.40)

Since \(\mathcal{S}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{O}_{M}\), we infer from (2.3.40) that

\[\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\eta_{j}(D)u=u\quad\text{in }\mathcal{S}^{\prime}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\qquad u\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\] (2.3.41)

thanks to (2.3.1).

Dyadic decompositions are a standard tool in harmonic analysis and the theory of function spaces (see [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], for example, and the references in these books).

### Multiplier Spaces

In this subsection we prove some simple technical results that will be useful for verifying that certain maps define Fourier multipliers. Since positively homogeneous functions play a particularly important role in this connection, we also introduce spaces of homogeneous maps and collect some examples. For later purposes we allow suitable parameter dependencies.

#### Computing Derivatives

Let \(X\) be a nonempty open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), let \(E_{0},E_{1},\ldots,E_{\ell}\) be Banach spaces, and let

\[E_{1}\times\cdots\times E_{\ell}\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(x_{1},\ldots,x_{\ell}) \mapsto x_{1}\bullet\cdots\bullet x_{\ell}\]

be a multiplication. Given \(a_{j}\in C^{k}(X,E_{j})\), it follows from the product rule (1.3.2) by induction that \(a_{1}\bullet\cdots\bullet a_{\ell}\in C^{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\) and

\[\partial^{\alpha}(a_{1}\bullet\cdots\bullet a_{\ell})=\sum_{\alpha_{1},\ldots, \alpha_{\ell}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\atop\alpha_{1}+\cdots+\alpha_{\ell}=\alpha} \partial^{\alpha_{1}}a_{1}\bullet\cdots\bullet\partial^{\alpha_{\ell}}a_{\ell}\] (2.4.1)

for \(|\alpha|\leq k\).

Let \(X\) be a topological space, \(E\) a Banach space, and \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\) a LCS satisfying \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\hookrightarrow C(X,E)\). Then, given any nonempty subset \(Y\) of \(E\),

\[\mathfrak{F}(X,Y):=\big{\{}\,u\in\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\ ;\ u(X)\subset Y\,\big{\}}\ ,\]

endowed with the topology induced by \(\mathfrak{F}(X,E)\).

---

Let \(F\) be a second Banach space. Recall that \({\cal L}{\rm is}(E,F)\) is open in \({\cal L}(E,F)\) and that the inversion map

\[{\rm inv}:\ {\cal L}{\rm is}(E,F)\to{\cal L}{\rm is}(F,E)\ ,\quad A\mapsto A^{-1}\]

is smooth with

\[\bigl{[}\partial\,{\rm inv}(A)\bigr{]}B=-A^{-1}BA^{-1}\ ,\qquad A\in{\cal L}{\rm is }(E,F)\ ,\quad B\in{\cal L}(E,F),\]

(e.g., [Die69, Theorem (8.3.2) and Example (8.12.11)]).

**2.4.1 Lemma** _Let \(X\) be open in \({{R}}^{n}\) and suppose that \(a\in C^{k}\bigl{(}X,{\cal L}{\rm is}(E,F)\bigr{)}\) for some \(k\in{{N}}\). Then \(a^{-1}\in C^{k}\bigl{(}X,{\cal L}{\rm is}(F,E)\bigr{)}\) and_

\[\partial^{\alpha}a^{-1}=\varepsilon_{\alpha}\sum_{j=1}^{|\alpha|}\sum_{{a_{1}, \ldots,a_{j}\in({{N}}^{n})^{\bullet}\atop a_{1}+\cdots+a_{j}=\alpha}}a^{-1}( \partial^{\alpha_{1}}a)a^{-1}\cdots(\partial^{\alpha_{j}}a)a^{-1}\ ,\qquad| \alpha|\leq k\ ,\]

_where \(\varepsilon_{\alpha}\in\{-1,1\}\)._

**Proof** From (2.4.3) and the chain rule we infer

\[\partial_{j}a^{-1}=-a^{-1}(\partial_{j}a)a^{-1}\ ,\qquad 1\leq j\leq n\ .\]

Now (2.4.1) (with the composition of bounded linear operators as a multiplication) implies the assertion by induction.

**Multilinear Symmetric Maps**

An \(m\)-linear map \(T:\ E^{m}\to F\) is **symmetric** if

\[T(e_{1},\ldots,e_{m})=T(e_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,e_{\sigma(m)})\ ,\qquad(e_{1}, \ldots,e_{m})\in E^{m}\ ,\quad\sigma\in{\sf S}_{m}\ ,\]

where \({\sf S}_{m}\) is the group of all permutations of \(m\) elements. It is clear that

\[{\cal L}^{m}_{\rm sym}(E,F):=\bigl{\{}\,T\in{\cal L}^{m}(E,F)\ ;\ T\ {\rm is \ symmetric}\,\bigr{\}}\]

is a closed linear subspace of \({\cal L}^{m}(E,F)\), hence a Banach space. Recall that, given an open subset \(U\) of \(E\),

\[\partial^{m}f\in C\bigl{(}U,{\cal L}^{m}_{\rm sym}(E,F)\bigr{)}\ ,\qquad f \in C^{m}(U,F)\ .\]

**The Chain Rule**

Now suppose that \(X\) is open in \({{R}}^{n}\) and \(\varphi\in C^{m}(X,U)\). Then \(\varphi^{*}f:=f\circ\varphi\), the pull-back of \(f\) by \(\varphi\), belongs to \(C^{m}(X,F)\) and

\[\partial_{j}(\varphi^{*}f)=(\varphi^{*}\partial f)\partial_{j}\varphi\ ,\qquad 1 \leq j\leq n\ ,\]

by the chain rule. In the following lemma we describe the qualitative form of the higher derivatives of \(\varphi^{*}f\), where we write \([e]^{m}\) for the \(m\)-tuple \((e,e,\ldots,e)\).

---

**2.4.2 Lemma**: _Suppose that \(X\) is open in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), that \(U\) is open in \(E\), and that \(\varphi\in C^{m}(X,U)\) and \(f\in C^{m}(U,F)\). Then, given \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\) with \(|\alpha|=m>0\),_

\[\partial^{\alpha}(\varphi^{*}f)=\sum c_{\beta,\gamma}\varphi^{*}\partial^{|\beta |}f\big{(}[\partial^{\gamma_{1}}\varphi]^{\beta_{1}},\ldots,[\partial^{\gamma_ {m}}\varphi]^{\beta_{m}}\big{)}\ ,\]

_where the summation extends over all \((\beta,\gamma)\in\mathbb{N}^{m}\times(\mathbb{N}^{n})^{m}\) satisfying \(|\gamma_{i}|>0\) for \(i=1,\ldots,m\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^{m}\beta_{i}\,|\gamma_{i}|=m\). The constants \(c_{\beta,\gamma}\) depend on \(\beta\), \(\gamma\), \(n\), and \(m\) only._

ProofThis follows by induction from the chain rule.

For \(z\in\mathbb{C}\) we put

\[\Lambda^{z}(\xi,\rho):=\Lambda^{z}_{\rho}(\xi):=(|\xi|^{2}+\rho^{2})^{z/2}\ , \qquad(\xi,\rho)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}\ .\]

Thus \(\Lambda:=\Lambda^{1}\) is the Euclidean norm on \(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\). (We do not indicate \(n\), the dimension of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), in this notation, since its value will always be clear from the context.)

#### Spaces of Multipliers

For \(m\in\mathbb{R}\) and \(\rho\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\) we denote by

\[S^{m}_{\rho}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E):=\big{(}S^{m}_{\rho}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E),\|\cdot\| _{S^{m}_{\rho}}\big{)}\]

the set of all \(a\in C^{n+1}\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star},E\big{)}\) such that

\[\|a\|_{S^{m}_{\rho}}:=\max_{|\alpha|\leq n+1}\|\Lambda^{|\alpha|-m}_{\rho} \partial^{\alpha}a\|_{\infty}<\infty\ .\]

It is easily verified that \(S^{m}_{\rho}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) is a Banach space such that

\[S^{m}_{\rho}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow BC^{n+1}\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n}) ^{\star},E\big{)}\hookrightarrow L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\qquad m\leq 0\ , \quad\rho>0\ ,\]

and

\[S^{m}_{\rho}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow W^{n+1}_{1,\mathrm{loc}}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\qquad m>0\ ,\quad\rho>0\ .\]

Each \(a\in S^{m}_{\rho}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) is a regular distribution on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) whose distributional derivatives of order \(\leq n+1\) are represented on \((\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star}\) by continuous functions. Hence it is obvious that

\[S^{0}_{\rho}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow S^{0}_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E) \hookrightarrow\mathcal{M}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\qquad\rho\geq 0\ ,\] (2.4.7)

where the norms of these injections are bounded by \(1\) and where \(\mathcal{M}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) is the (\(E\)-valued analogue) of the multiplier space introduced in [1, (III.4.4.6)]. As usual,

\[S^{m}_{\rho}(\mathbb{R}^{n}):=S^{m}_{\rho}(\mathbb{R}^{n},\mathbb{K})\quad \text{and}\quad S^{m}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E):=S^{m}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ .\]

The reason for considering \(n+1\) derivatives in the definition of \(S^{m}_{\rho}\) will become apparent by looking at the multiplier theorems of Subsection 2.5.

---

In the following,

\[E_{1}\times E_{2}\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(e_{1},e_{2})\mapsto e_{1}\bullet e_{2}\] (2.4.8)

is a multiplication.

**2.4.3 Remarks**:
**(a)**: For \(m_{1},m_{2}\in\mathbb{R}\) point-wise multiplication induced by (2.4.8),

\[S_{\rho}^{m_{1}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\times S_{\rho}^{m_{2}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E _{2})\to S_{\rho}^{m_{1}+m_{2}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\ ,\quad(a_{1},a_{2})\mapsto a _{1}\bullet a_{2}\ ,\]

is well-defined, bilinear, and continuous.

**Proof** Leibniz' rule.
**(b)**: If \(\rho,\sigma>0\) then \(S_{\rho}^{m}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\doteq S_{\sigma}^{m}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and

\[\big{(}1\wedge(\sigma/\rho)^{n+1-m}\big{)}\,\|\!\cdot\!\|_{S_{\rho}^{m}}\leq\| \!\cdot\!\|_{S_{\sigma}^{m}}\leq\big{(}1\vee(\sigma/\rho)^{n+1-m}\big{)}\,\| \!\cdot\!\|_{S_{\rho}^{m}}\ .\]

**Proof** This is implied by the estimate

\[1\wedge(\sigma/\rho)\leq\Lambda_{\sigma}\Lambda_{\rho}^{-1}\leq 1\vee(\sigma/ \rho)\ ,\qquad\rho,\sigma>0\ ,\] (2.4.9)

which is obvious.
**(c)**: Suppose that \(a\in S_{\rho}^{0}\big{(}\mathbb{R}^{n},{\cal L}{\rm is}(E,F)\big{)}\) satisfies \(a^{-1}\in B\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star},{\cal L}(F,E)\big{)}\). Then \(a^{-1}\in S_{\rho}^{0}\big{(}\mathbb{R}^{n},{\cal L}(F,E)\big{)}\) and

\[\|a^{-1}\|_{S_{\rho}^{0}}\leq c\big{(}\|a\|_{S_{\rho}^{0}},\|a^{-1}\|_{\infty} \big{)}\ ,\]

where \(c\in C\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{+})^{2}\big{)}\) is independent of \(a\).
**Proof** This follows from Lemma 2.4.1.
**(d)**: Let \(U\) be open in \(E\) and suppose that \(f\in C^{n+1}(U,F)\) satisfies

\[\|f\|_{n+1,\infty}:=\max_{0\leq k\leq n+1}\|\partial^{k}f\|_{\infty}<\infty\ .\]

Then \(f(a)\in S_{\rho}^{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},F)\) for \(a\in S_{\rho}^{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},U)\), and

\[\|f(a)\|_{S_{\rho}^{0}}\leq c\big{(}\|a\|_{S_{\rho}^{0}}\big{)}\,\|f\|_{n+1, \infty}\ ,\]

where \(c\in C(\mathbb{R}^{+})\) and is independent of \(a\) and \(f\).
**Proof** The assertion is easily deduced from Lemma 2.4.2.
**(e)**: If \(m_{1}\geq m_{0}\) then \(S_{\rho}^{m_{0}}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow S_{\rho}^{m_{1}}(\mathbb{R} ^{n},E)\) for \(\rho>0\), and the norm of this injection is bounded by \(\rho^{m_{0}-m_{1}}\).

---

**Homogeneous Functions**

The problem of verifying that a given \(a\in C^{n+1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) belongs to \(S_{\rho}^{m}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and of estimating the corresponding norm can often easily be solved if \(a\) is suitably positively homogeneous. For this reason we now collect some facts about maps of this type.

Let \(V\) and \(W\) be vector spaces and let \(P\) be a cone in \(V\). Then \(a:\,\hat{P}\to W\) is **positively homogeneous of degree \(z\in{\mathbb{C}}\)** if

\[a(tv)=t^{z}a(v)\ ,\qquad t>0\ ,\quad v\in\hat{P}\ .\]

If this is the case and \(\mathop{\rm Re}z>0\), then we always extend \(a\) to a map from \(P\) to \(W\), again denoted by \(a\), by putting \(a(0):=0\).

**2.4.4 Remarks**:
**(a)**: The set of all \(a:\,\hat{P}\to W\) that are positively homogeneous of degree \(z\) for some fixed \(z\in{\mathbb{C}}\) is a vector subspace of \(W^{\hat{P}}\).
**(b)**: If \(a_{j}:\,\hat{P}\to E_{j}\) is positively homogeneous of degree \(z_{j}\) for \(j=1,2\), then the map \(a_{1}\bullet a_{2}:\,\hat{P}\to E_{0}\) is positively homogeneous of degree \(z_{1}+z_{2}\).
**(c)**: Suppose that \(W_{1}\) and \(W_{2}\) are vector spaces and \(a:\,\hat{P}\to\mathop{\rm Hom}(W_{1},W_{2})\) is positively homogeneous of degree \(z\). If \(a(v)\) is bijective for each \(v\in\hat{P}\), then

\[a^{-1}:\,P\to\mathop{\rm Hom}(W_{2},W_{1})\]

is positively homogeneous of degree \(-z\).

**Proof** From

\[1_{W_{1}}=a^{-1}(tv)a(tv)=t^{z}a^{-1}(tv)a(v)\]

and

\[1_{W_{2}}=a(tv)a^{-1}(tv)=a(v)t^{z}a^{-1}(tv)\]

for \(v\in\hat{P}\) and \(t>0\) we see that \(t^{z}a^{-1}(tv)=a^{-1}(v)\), thanks to the uniqueness of the inverse.
**(d)**: Suppose that \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\). Then \(u\) is **positively homogeneous of degree \(z\in{\mathbb{C}}\)** if \(\sigma_{t^{-1}}u=t^{z}u\), \(t>0\). This agrees apparently with the above definition if \(u\) is a regular distribution. If \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) is positively homogeneous of degree \(z\) for some \(z\in{\mathbb{C}}\), then \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and \(\widehat{u}\) and \({\cal F}^{-1}u\) are positively homogeneous of degree \(-z-n\). If, in addition, \(u\in C^{k}\bigl{(}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})^{\star},E\bigr{)}\) for some \(k>\mathop{\rm Re}z+n\), then \(\partial^{\alpha}\widehat{u}\in C\bigl{(}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})^{\star},E\bigr{)}\) for \(|\alpha|<k-\mathop{\rm Re}z-n\).

**Proof** The proof of [Hor83, Theorem 7.1.18] carries over to the \(E\)-valued case to show that \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and that the last assertion is true. Hence we can apply (2.3.9) to obtain

\[t^{z}{\cal F}u={\cal F}(t^{z}u)={\cal F}(\sigma_{t^{-1}}u)=t^{n}\sigma_{t}{ \cal F}u\ .\]

---

Consequently, \(\sigma_{t^{-1}}\widehat{u}=t^{-z-n}\,\widehat{u}\). Thus, by replacing \(\mathcal{F}\) by \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\) in this argument, we obtain the second assertion.

Now we suppose that \(\mathsf{H}\) is a cone in some Banach space \(\mathsf{H}:=(\mathsf{H},|\cdot|)\). Then

\[\mathbb{R}^{n}\,\times\,\mathsf{H}\to\mathbb{R}\ ,\quad(\xi,\eta)\mapsto \Lambda(\xi,|\eta|)\]

is the 'Euclidean' norm on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,\times\,\mathsf{H}\) and

\[(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,\times\,\mathsf{H})^{\ast}\to\left[\Lambda(\xi,|\eta|)=1 \right]\,,\quad(\xi,\eta)\mapsto(\xi^{\ast},\eta^{\ast}):=(\xi,\eta)\Lambda^{-1 }(\xi,|\eta|)\]

is the '**Euclidean' radial retraction** onto the unit-sphere of \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,\times\,\mathsf{H}\).

For \(a:\,(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast}\times\mathsf{H}\to E\) we often set

\[a_{\eta}:=a(\cdot,\eta):\,(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast}\to E\ .\]

Of course, if \(\mathsf{H}=\{0\}\), then we identify \((\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast}\times\mathsf{H}\) and \((\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast}\) and omit any reference to \(\eta=0\).

**2.4.5 Lemma**: _Suppose that \(a:\,(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast}\times\mathsf{H}\to E\) is positively homogeneous of degree \(z\) for some \(z\in\mathbb{C}\) and that \(a_{\eta}\in C^{k}\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast},E\big{)}\) for some \(k\in\overleftarrow{\mathbb{N}}\) and each \(\eta\in\mathsf{H}\). Then \(\partial_{\xi}^{\alpha}a:\,(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast}\times\mathsf{H}\to E\) is positively homogeneous of degree \(z-|\alpha|\) and_

\[\partial^{\alpha}a_{\eta}(\xi)=\Lambda^{z-|\alpha|}(\xi,|\eta|)\partial_{\xi}^ {\alpha}a(\xi^{\ast},\eta^{\ast})\ ,\qquad(\xi,\eta)\in(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast} \times\mathsf{H}\ ,\]

_for \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\) with \(|\alpha|\leq k\)._

ProofBy differentiating the identity \(a(t\xi,t\eta)=t^{z}a(\xi,\eta)\) with respect to \(\xi\) it follows that

\[(\partial_{\xi}^{\alpha}a)(t\xi,t\eta)=t^{z-|\alpha|}\partial_{\xi}^{\alpha}a( \xi,\eta)\ ,\qquad t>0\ ,\quad(\xi,\eta)\in(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast}\times \mathsf{H}\ ,\]

proving the first assertion. The second one follows now if we replace \((\xi,\eta)\) by \((\xi^{\ast},\eta^{\ast})\) and \(t\) by \(\Lambda(\xi,|\eta|)\), respectively.

#### Spaces of Homogeneous Functions and Multipliers

For \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) and \(z\in\mathbb{C}\) we denote by

\[\mathcal{H}^{k}_{z}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,\times\,\mathsf{H},E):=\big{(}\mathcal{H} ^{k}_{z}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,\times\,\mathsf{H},E),\|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{H}^{k}_{z} }\big{)}\]

the normed vector space of all \(a:\,(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast}\times\mathsf{H}\to E\) that are positively homogeneous of degree \(z\) and satisfy \(a_{\eta}\in C^{k}\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\ast},E\big{)}\) for \(\eta\in\mathsf{H}\) as well as

\[\|a\|_{\mathcal{H}^{k}_{z}}:=\max_{|\alpha|\leq k}\sup_{(\xi,\eta)\in(\mathbb{ R}^{n})^{\ast}\times\mathsf{H}}|\partial_{\xi}^{\alpha}a(\xi^{\ast},\eta^{ \ast})|<\infty\ .\]

---

Moreover,

\[{\cal H}^{\infty}_{z}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},E):=\bigcap_{k=0}^{ \infty}{\cal H}^{k}_{z}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},E)\ ,\]

equipped with the obvious projective limit topology. As usual,

\[{\cal H}^{k}_{z}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}}):={\cal H}^{k}_{z}({ \mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},{\mathbb{K}})\ ,\qquad k\in\bar{\mathbb{N}}\ ,\]

and

\[{\cal H}_{z}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},E):={\cal H}^{n+1}_{z}({ \mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},E)\ ,\qquad z\in{\mathbb{C}}\ .\]

**2.4.6 Remarks**: **(a)**: \((a\mapsto a_{\eta})\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\cal H}_{z}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{ \mathsf{H}},E),S^{{\rm Re}\,z}_{|\eta|}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\bigr{)}\) with the norm bounded by \(1\).

**Proof** This is a consequence of Lemma 2.4.5.

**(b)**: Point-wise multiplication induced by (2.4.8)

\[{\cal H}^{k}_{z_{1}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},E_{1})\times{\cal H}^ {k}_{z_{2}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},E_{2})\to{\cal H}^{k}_{z_{1}+z_ {2}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},E_{0})\ ,\quad(a_{1},a_{2})\mapsto a_{1} \bullet a_{2}\]

is well-defined, bilinear, and continuous for \(k\in\bar{\mathbb{N}}\) and \(z_{1},z_{2}\in{\mathbb{C}}\).

**Proof** Leibniz' rule and Remark 2.4.4(b).

**(c)**: Suppose that \(a\in{\cal H}^{k}_{z}\bigl{(}{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},{\cal L}(E,F) \bigr{)}\) satisfies \(a(\xi^{*},\eta^{*})\in{\cal L}{\rm is}(E,F)\) and

\[\|a^{-1}\|_{\infty,[\Lambda=1]}=\sup_{(\xi,\eta)\in({\mathbb{R}}^{n})^{*} \times{\mathsf{H}}}|a^{-1}(\xi^{*},\eta^{*})|_{{\cal L}(F,E)}<\infty\ .\]

Then \(a^{-1}\in{\cal H}^{k}_{-z}\bigl{(}{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}},{\cal L}( F,E)\bigr{)}\) and

\[\|a^{-1}\|_{{\cal H}^{k}_{-z}}\leq c\bigl{(}\|a\|_{{\cal H}^{k}_{z}},\|a^{-1}\|_ {\infty,[\Lambda=1]}\bigr{)}\ ,\]

where \(c\in C\bigl{(}({\mathbb{R}}^{+})^{2}\bigr{)}\).

**Proof** It follows from Remark 2.4.4(c) that \(a^{-1}\) is well-defined as a map from \(({\mathbb{R}}^{n})^{*}\times{\mathsf{H}}\) into \({\cal L}(F,E)\) and is positively homogeneous. Now the assertion is a consequence of Lemma 2.4.1.

To conclude, we consider three simple but most important examples. They will be the basis for many computations in connection with Fourier multipliers.

**2.4.7 Examples**: **(a)**: \(\bigl{[}(\xi,\eta)\mapsto\Lambda^{z}(\xi,|\eta|)\bigr{]}\in{\cal H}^{\infty}_ {z}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathsf{H}})\) and

\[\|\Lambda^{z}\|_{{\cal H}^{k}_{z}}\leq c(k)(1+|z|^{k})\ ,\qquad z\in{\mathbb{C}}\ , \quad k\in{\mathbb{N}}\ .\]

**Proof** First we note that \(\Lambda_{|\eta|}\in C^{\infty}\bigl{(}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})^{*}\bigr{)}\) for \(\eta\in{\mathsf{H}}\) and that \(\Lambda\) is positively homogeneous of degree \(1\). Moreover,

\[\partial_{j}\Lambda_{|\eta|}(\xi)=\xi_{j}\Lambda_{|\eta|}^{-1}(\xi)\ ,\qquad\xi=(\xi_{1},\ldots,\xi_{n})\in({\mathbb{R}}^{n})^{*}\ ,\quad\eta\in{\mathsf{H}}\ ,\quad 1\leq j\leq n\ .\]

---

Now we infer from (2.4.1) and Lemma 2.4.1 that

\[|\partial_{\xi}^{\alpha}\Lambda(\xi^{*},|\eta^{*}|)|\leq c(\alpha)\ ,\qquad\alpha \in\mathbb{N}^{n}\ .\]

Consequently, \(\Lambda\in\mathcal{H}_{1}^{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathsf{H})\) and \(\|\Lambda\|_{\mathcal{H}_{1}^{k}}\leq c(k)\). Next we put \(f(t):=t^{z}\) for \(z\in\mathbb{C}\). Then \(f\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{+})\) and

\[\partial^{j}f(t)=z(z-1)\cdots(z-j+1)t^{z-j}\ ,\qquad t>0\ ,\quad j\in\mathbb{N}\ .\]

Hence \(|\partial^{j}f(1)|\leq c(j)(1+|z|^{j})\), and the assertion follows from \(\Lambda^{z}=f(\Lambda)\) and Lemma 2.4.2.

**(b)**: If \(\eta\in\mathsf{H}\) then \(\Lambda^{z}_{|\eta|}\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\).

**Proof** We obtain the assertion from (a) and Lemma 2.4.5 thanks to the fact that \(\Lambda^{z}_{\rho}\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and \(\Lambda_{\rho}\geq\rho\).

**(c)**: Let \(a_{\alpha}:\mathsf{H}\to E\) be positively homogeneous of degree \(m-|\alpha|\) for \(|\alpha|\leq m\) and put

\[a(\xi,\eta):=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m}a_{\alpha}(\eta)\xi^{\alpha}\ ,\qquad(\xi, \eta)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathsf{H}\ .\]

Then \(a\in\mathcal{H}_{m}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathsf{H},E)\) and

\[\|a\|_{\mathcal{H}_{m}^{k}}\leq c\max_{|\alpha|\leq m}\sup_{|\eta|\leq 1}|a_{ \alpha}(\eta)|\ ,\qquad k\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\]

since \(\partial^{\alpha}a_{\eta}=0\) for \(|\alpha|>m\).

Below we often identify \(\Lambda^{z}\) with \(\Lambda^{z}1_{E}\). In other words, we consider \(\Lambda^{z}\) as an element of \(\mathcal{H}_{z}^{\infty}\big{(}\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathsf{H},\mathcal{L}(E) \big{)}\). Then the estimates of Example 2.4.7(a) are valid in this case as well.

### Fourier Multipliers

In this subsection we derive some most important multiplier theorems for operator-valued symbols, of which Lemma 2.5.3 has to be especially mentioned. It entails, in particular, Lemma 2.5.6 that develops its full power in the framework of Besov spaces.

First we recall the multinomial theorem:

\[(x_{1}+\cdots+x_{n})^{m}=\sum_{|\alpha|=m}\frac{m!}{\alpha!}x^{\alpha}\ , \qquad m\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\quad n\in\lx@overaccentset{{\star}}{ \mathbb{N}}\ ,\quad x_{j}\in\mathbb{K}\ .\] (2.5.1)

---

Moreover, putting

\[{m\choose\alpha}:=\frac{m!}{\alpha!\,(m-|\alpha|)!}\ ,\qquad m\in\mathbb{N}\ , \quad\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\ ,\]

it follows from (2.5.1) that

\[(1+x_{1}+\cdots+x_{n})^{m}=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq m}{m\choose\alpha}x^{\alpha}\ , \qquad m\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\quad n\in\lx@overaccentset{{\bullet}}{ \mathbb{N}}\ ,\quad x_{j}\in\mathbb{K}\ .\] (2.5.2)

Observe that these formulas remain valid if \(\mathbb{K}\) is replaced by an algebra with unit, and \(x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}\) by commutative elements thereof.

#### The Multiplier Space \(\mathcal{F}L_{1}\)

Now let \(E:=(E,|\cdot|)\) be a Banach space. We put

\[\mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E):=\Big{(}\big{\{}\,u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime} (\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ;\ \mathcal{F}^{-1}u\in L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\,\big{\}},\ \|\!\cdot\!\|_{\mathcal{F}L_{1}}\Big{)}\ ,\]

where

\[\|u\|_{\mathcal{F}L_{1}}:=\|\mathcal{F}^{-1}u\|_{1}\ .\] (2.5.3)

As usual,

\[\mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}):=\mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},\mathbb{C})\ .\]

#### Proposition

* \(\mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,,E)\) _is a Banach space and_ \[\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}} \mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}C_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ .\] (2.5.4)
* _If_ \(E\) _is a Hilbert space and_ \(k>n/2\)_, then_ \[W^{k}_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}} \mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ .\] _Moreover,_ \[\|u\|_{\mathcal{F}L_{1}}\leq c\,\|u\|_{2}^{1-\theta}\,\Big{(}\max_{|\alpha|=k} \|\partial^{\alpha}u\|_{2}\Big{)}^{\theta}\leq c\,\|u\|_{2,k}\ ,\qquad u\in W^{k}_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\] _where_ \(\theta:=n/(2k)\)_._

Proof.: (i) It is obvious that \(\mathcal{F}L_{1}\) is a Banach space. Thanks to the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma,

\[\|u\|_{C_{0}}=\big{\|}\widehat{\mathcal{F}^{-1}u}\big{\|}_{C_{0}}\leq c\,\| \mathcal{F}^{-1}u\|_{1}=c\,\|u\|_{\mathcal{F}L_{1}}\ ,\qquad u\in\mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\]

hence \(\mathcal{F}L_{1}\hookrightarrow C_{0}\). Since \(\mathcal{S}\) is dense in \(L_{1}\) and \(\mathcal{F}\in\mathcal{L}\mathrm{aut}(\mathcal{S})\cap\mathcal{L}\mathrm{is}(L_ {1},\mathcal{F}L_{1})\), we infer that \(\mathcal{S}\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}\mathcal{F}L_{1}\). Consequently, (2.5.4) follows from \(\mathcal{S}\stackrel{{ d}}{{\hookrightarrow}}C_{0}\).

---

(ii) Let \(t>0\). By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and since \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}u=(2\pi)^{-n}\,\tilde{\vec{u}}\),

\[\int_{|x|>t}|\mathcal{F}^{-1}u|\,dx =(2\pi)^{-n}\int_{|\xi|>t}|\xi|^{-k}\,|\xi|^{k}\,|\widehat{u}(\xi)| \,d\xi\] \[\leq(2\pi)^{-n}\Bigl{(}\int_{|\xi|>t}|\xi|^{-2k}\,d\xi\Bigr{)}^{1/ 2}\Bigl{(}\int_{|\xi|>t}|\xi|^{2k}\,|\widehat{u}(\xi)|^{2}\,d\xi\Bigr{)}^{1/2}\] \[\leq ct^{n/2-k}\max_{|\alpha|=k}\|D^{\alpha}u\|_{2}\ ,\]

where we used (2.5.1) and Plancherel's theorem in the last step. Similarly, we find

\[\int_{|x|\leq t}|\mathcal{F}^{-1}u|\,dx\leq(2\pi)^{-n}\Bigl{(}\int_{|\xi|\leq t }1\,d\xi\Bigr{)}^{1/2}\Bigl{(}\int_{|\xi|\leq t}|\widehat{u}(\xi)|^{2}\,d\xi \Bigr{)}^{1/2}\leq ct^{n/2}\,\|u\|_{2}\ .\]

Thus

\[\|\mathcal{F}^{-1}u\|_{1}\leq ct^{n/2}\Bigl{(}\|u\|_{2}+t^{-k}\max_{|\alpha|=k} \|\partial^{\alpha}u\|_{2}\Bigr{)}\ ,\qquad t>0\ ,\]

and the assertion follows by estimating the minimum of the right-hand side with respect to \(t>0\).

#### Multiplier Theorems

Now suppose that \(E_{j},\ \ j=0,1,2\), are Banach spaces and

\[E_{1}\times E_{2}\to E_{0}\ ,\quad(e_{1},e_{2})\mapsto e_{1}\bullet e_{2}\] (2.5.5)

is a multiplication. The following simple multiplier result is the reason for introducing the space \(\mathcal{F}L_{1}\).

**2.5.2 Theorem**: _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\,BUC,C_{0},L_{p}\ ;\ 1\leq p<\infty\,\}\). Then_

\[\bigl{[}a\mapsto a(D)\bigr{]}\in\mathcal{L}\Bigl{(}\mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R} ^{n}\,,E_{1}),\mathcal{L}\bigl{(}\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2}),\mathfrak{ F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{0})\bigr{)}\Bigr{)}\ .\]

_Moreover,_

\[\bigl{[}a\mapsto a(D)\bigr{]}\in\mathcal{L}\Bigl{(}\mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R} ^{n}\,,E_{1}),\mathcal{L}\bigl{(}L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{2}),BUC(\mathbb{ R}^{n},E_{0})\bigr{)}\Bigr{)}\ .\]

_The norms of these linear maps are bounded by \(1\)._

**Proof** This follows immediately from Theorem 1.9.9 and Remark 1.9.11(b).

Now we prove some criteria for a distribution to belong to \(\mathcal{F}L_{1}\). They will play an important role in the sequel. For this we fix \(\psi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) satisfying (2.3.13) and denote by \((\psi_{k})\) and \((\eta_{j})\) the dyadic resolutions on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and on \((\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star}\), respectively, induced by \(\psi\). We also recall that \(\Omega_{0}:=2\mathbb{B}^{n}\) and \(\Sigma_{j}:=2^{j+1}\bar{\mathbb{B}}^{n}\setminus(2^{j-1}\mathbb{B}^{n})\) for \(j\in\mathbb{Z}\).

---

**2.5.3 Lemma**: _Suppose that \(a\in{\cal D}^{\prime}\big{(}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})^{\raise 1.0pt\hbox{\tiny{$ \bullet$}}},E\big{)}\) and all its derivatives of order less than or equal to \(n+1\) are regular distributions._

* _Given_ \(j\in{\mathbb{Z}}\)_, suppose that_ \[\mu_{j}:=\max_{|\alpha|\leq n+1}\|\Lambda_{0}^{|\alpha|}\partial^{\alpha}a\|_{ \infty,\Sigma_{j}}<\infty\ .\] _Then_ \(\eta_{j}a\in{\cal F}L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\) _and_ \[\|\eta_{j}a\|_{{\cal F}L_{1}}\leq c\mu_{j}\ ,\] _where_ \(c=c(n,\psi)\) _is independent of_ \(a\) _and_ \(j\)_._
* _If_ \(a\in W_{\infty}^{n+1}(\Omega_{0},E)\)_, then_ \(\psi a\in{\cal F}L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,,E)\) _and_ \[\|\psi a\|_{{\cal F}L_{1}}\leq c\,\|a\|_{n+1,\infty,\Omega_{0}}\ ,\] _where_ \(c\) _is independent of_ \(a\)_._

**Proof** (i) Since \(\eta_{j}a=(\sigma_{2^{j}}\widetilde{\psi})a=\sigma_{2^{j}}(\widetilde{\psi} \sigma_{2^{-j}}a)\), it follows from (2.3.10) that

\[{\cal F}^{-1}(\eta_{j}a)=2^{jn}\sigma_{2^{-j}}{\cal F}^{-1}(\widetilde{\psi} \sigma_{2^{-j}}a)\ .\]

Now we obtain from (2.3.12) and (2.5.3) that

\[\|\eta_{j}a\|_{{\cal F}L_{1}}=\|\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2^{-j}}a\|_{{\cal F}L_ {1}}\ .\] (2.5.6)

Leibniz' rule and (2.3.11) imply

\[\partial^{\alpha}(\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2^{-j}}a)=\sum_{\beta\leq\alpha}{ \alpha\choose\beta}2^{j|\beta|}(\sigma_{2^{-j}}\partial^{\beta}a)\partial^{ \alpha-\beta}\widetilde{\psi}\ .\]

Thus, since \(\hbox{supp}(\partial^{\alpha-\beta}\widetilde{\psi})\subset\Sigma_{0}\), it follows that

\[|\partial^{\alpha}(\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2^{-j}}a)(\xi)|\leq c\sum_{\beta \leq\alpha}2^{j|\beta|}\,|\partial^{\beta}a(2^{j}\xi)|\,\chi_{\Sigma_{0}}(\xi )\leq c\mu_{j}\chi_{\Sigma_{0}}(\xi)\]

for \(|\alpha|\leq n+1\) and a.a. \(\xi\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\). Hence \(\partial^{\alpha}(\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2^{-j}}a)\in L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n} \,,E)\) and

\[\|\partial^{\alpha}(\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2^{-j}}a)\|_{1}\leq c\mu_{j}\ , \qquad|\alpha|\leq n+1\ .\] (2.5.7)

Consequently, by (2.3.2), (2.3.3), and the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma,

\[x^{\alpha}{\cal F}^{-1}(\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2^{-j}}a)={\cal F}^{-1}\big{(} D^{\alpha}(\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2^{-j}}a)\big{)}\in C_{0}({\mathbb{R}}^{n} \,,E)\]

and

\[|x^{\alpha}{\cal F}^{-1}(\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2^{-j}}a)(x)|\leq c\mu_{j}\ , \qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ ,\quad|\alpha|\leq n+1\ .\] (2.5.8)

---

Since, by (2.5.1),

\[|x|^{k}=\big{(}(x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2})^{k}\big{)}^{1/2}\leq c(k,n)\sum_{| \alpha|=k}|x^{\alpha}|\ ,\qquad k\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\] (2.5.9)

it follows from (2.5.8) that

\[|\mathcal{F}^{-1}\big{(}\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2-j}\,a)(x)|\leq c\mu_{j}\,|x| ^{-n-1}\ \ ,\qquad x\in(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star}\ .\] (2.5.10)

Hence, thanks to (2.5.8) and (2.5.10),

\[\|\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2-j}\,a\|_{\mathcal{F}L_{1}}=\|\mathcal{F}^{-1} \big{(}\widetilde{\psi}\sigma_{2-j}\,a\big{)}\|_{1}\leq c\mu_{j}\Big{[}\int_{| x|\leq 1}1\,dx+\int_{|x|\geq 1}|x|^{-n-1}\,dx\Big{]}=c\mu_{j}\ .\]

Now the assertion is a consequence of (2.5.6).

(ii) From Leibniz' rule we infer that

\[|\partial^{\alpha}(\psi a)|\leq c\sum_{\beta\leq\alpha}|\partial^{\beta}a|\, \chi_{\Omega_{0}}\,\leq c\,\|a\|_{n+1,\infty,\Omega_{0}}\,\chi_{\Omega_{0}}\]

for \(|\alpha|\leq n+1\). Now the arguments of (i) apply if we replace \(\widetilde{\psi}\) by \(\psi\) and set \(j:=0\) and \(\mu_{0}:=\|a\|_{n+1,\infty,\Omega_{0}}\).

**2.5.4 Theorem**: _Suppose that \(a\in L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and all derivatives of order \(\leq n+1\) are regular distributions on \((\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star}\). Put_

\[\mu_{j}:=\max_{|\alpha|\leq n+1}\|\Lambda_{0}^{|\alpha|}\partial^{\alpha}a\|_{ \infty,\Sigma_{j}}\ ,\qquad j\in\mathbb{Z}\ ,\]

_and_

\[\lambda_{0}:=\max_{|\alpha|\leq n+1}\|\partial^{\alpha}a\|_{\infty,\Omega_{0}} \ .\]

_Also suppose that_

\[\kappa:=\Big{(}\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\mu_{j}\Big{)}\wedge\Big{(}\lambda_{0} +\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\mu_{j}\Big{)}<\infty\ .\]

_Then \(a\in\mathcal{F}L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(\|a\|_{\mathcal{F}L_{1}}\leq c\kappa\), where \(c\) is independent of \(\kappa\) and \(a\)._

**Proof** Given \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), it follows from (2.3.20) and Lebesgue's theorem that

\[\Big{(}\sum_{j=-k^{\prime}}^{k}\eta_{j}a\Big{)}(\varphi)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} a\big{(}\psi(2^{-k}\cdot)-\psi(2^{k^{\prime}+1}\cdot)\big{)}\varphi\,dx\to a (\varphi)\]

as \(k,k^{\prime}\to\infty\). Thus the Banach-Steinhaus theorem and the fact that \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) is a Montel space imply

\[\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}\eta_{j}a=a\qquad\text{in }\mathcal{S}^{\prime}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ .\] (2.5.11)

---

Similarly,

\[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\psi_{k}a=a\qquad\text{in }{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ .\] (2.5.12)

Lemma 2.5.3 gives

\[\sum_{j=-k^{\prime}}^{k}\|\eta_{j}a\|_{{\cal F}L_{1}}\leq c\sum_{j=-\infty}^{ \infty}\mu_{j}\]

and, thanks to \(\psi_{j}=\eta_{j}\) for \(j\in{\mathbb{N}}\),

\[\sum_{j=0}^{k}\|\psi_{k}a\|_{{\cal F}L_{1}}\leq\lambda_{0}+c\sum_{j=0}^{\infty }\mu_{j}\]

for \(k,k^{\prime}\in{\mathbb{N}}\). Hence the series on the left-hand sides of (2.5.11) and (2.5.12) converge in the Banach space \({\cal F}L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) if the right-hand sides in the corresponding estimates are finite. Now the assertion follows from the continuous injection of \({\cal F}L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) in \({\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and from (2.5.11) and (2.5.12), respectively.

**2.5.5 Corollary**: _Suppose that \(a\in W_{\infty}^{n+1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and there exists \(\varepsilon>0\) such that_

\[\|a\|_{n+1,\infty}+\max_{|\alpha|\leq n+1}\|\Lambda_{0}^{|\alpha|+\varepsilon} \partial^{\alpha}a\|_{\infty}\leq\mu<\infty\ .\]

_Then \(a\in{\cal F}L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) and the estimate \(\|a\|_{{\cal F}L_{1}}\leq c\mu\) holds, where \(c:=c(\varepsilon,n)\) is independent of \(\mu\) and \(a\)._

**Proof** Note that \(\lambda_{0}\leq\|a\|_{n+1,\infty}\leq\mu\) and

\[\max_{|\alpha|\leq n+1}\left|\xi\right|^{\alpha}\left|\partial^{\alpha}a(\xi) \right|\leq\mu\left|\xi\right|^{-\varepsilon}\ ,\qquad\text{a.a.}\ \xi\in({ \mathbb{R}}^{n})^{c}\ .\]

Hence \(\mu_{j}\leq\mu 2^{-(j-1)\varepsilon}\) for \(j\in\overset{\centerdot}{\mathbb{N}}\) so that \(\kappa\leq\mu\bigl{[}1+(1-2^{-\varepsilon})^{-1}\bigr{]}\).

It should be noted that there is no restriction on the Banach space \(E\). This is in contrast to Proposition 2.5.1(ii) where \(E\) has to be a Hilbert space since its proof is based on Plancherel's theorem.

**2.5.6 Theorem**: _Suppose that \(\psi\in{\cal D}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) with \(\psi|\,{\mathbb{B}}^{n}=1\) and \(\operatorname{supp}(\psi)\subset 2{\mathbb{B}}^{n}\), and let \((\psi_{k})\) be the dyadic resolution of the identity on \({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\) induced by \(\psi\). Also suppose that_

\[{\mathfrak{F}}\in\{\,\mbox{BUC},C_{0},L_{p}\ ;\ 1\leq p<\infty\,\}\ .\]

_Then_

\[(\psi_{k}a)(D)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}{\mathfrak{F}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2}),{ \mathfrak{F}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{0})\bigr{)}\]

_and_

\[(\psi_{k}a)(D)\in{\cal L}\bigl{(}L_{\infty}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{2}),\mbox{BUC} ({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E_{0})\bigr{)}\]

---

_for \(a\in S^{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\), and_

\[\sup_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\|(\psi_{k}a)(D)\|\leq c\,\|a\|_{S^{0}}\ \ ,\qquad a\in S^{0}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E_{1})\ ,\]

_where \(c\) is independent of \(a\)._

**Proof** If \(a\in S^{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) then \(\|a\|_{n+1,\infty}\leq\|a\|_{S^{0}}\) and \(\mu_{j}\leq\|a\|_{S^{0}}\) for \(j\in\mathbb{N}\). Hence the assertion follows from Lemma 2.5.3 and Theorem 2.5.2.

**2.5.7 Corollary** _Given the hypotheses of Theorem 2.5.6,_

\[\psi_{k}(D)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\cap \mathcal{L}\big{(}L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E),BUC(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ , \qquad k\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\]

_and \(\sup_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\|\psi_{k}(D)\|<\infty\)._

**Proof** Choose \(a:=1_{E}\).

Multiplier theorems of the type of Theorem 2.5.4 and its corollary are well-known in the scalar case (e.g., [1, Exercise 6.8.3] or [15, Lemma 3.3]). In this case the proof is usually based on Proposition 2.5.1(ii) so that the order of differentiation can be reduced from \(n+1\) to \([n/2]+1\). This requires, however, the use of Plancherel's theorem that is valid only if \(E\) is a Hilbert space. (Thus Lemma 6.1.5 in [1] does not hold for \(E=\mathcal{L}(H_{0},H_{1})\), in general, since \(\mathcal{L}(H_{0},H_{1})\) is not a Hilbert space if \(H_{0}\) and \(H_{1}\) are infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.) For our purpose it will be important that in Corollary 2.5.5 and Theorem 2.5.6 we do not have to impose restrictions on the Banach space \(E\). These results are due to the author [1].

#### A Limiting Case

We close this subsection by proving that Corollary 2.5.5 is close to being optimal in the sense that we cannot expect to obtain a similar result with \(\varepsilon=0\).

**2.5.8 Proposition** _Suppose \(a\in L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\cap C^{n+1}\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star} \big{)}\) is a Fourier multiplier for \(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), where \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{BUC,C_{0},L_{1},L_{\infty}\}\). If \(a\) is positively homogeneous of degree \(0\) then \(a\) is constant._

**Proof** By assumption \(a(D)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\big{)}\) and

\[\|\mathcal{F}^{-1}a\ast u\|_{\mathfrak{F}}\leq c\,\|u\|_{\mathfrak{F}}\ ,\qquad u\in\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ .\] (2.5.13)

First we suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\neq L_{1}\). If \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) then we know that \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}a\ast\varphi\in\mathcal{E}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and that \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}a\ast\varphi(0)=\langle\mathcal{F}^{-1}a,\varphi\rangle\). Hence it follows from (2.5.13) that

\[|\langle\mathcal{F}^{-1}a,\varphi\rangle|\leq c\,\|\varphi\|_{\infty}\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\ .\] (2.5.14)

By restricting ourselves to \(\varphi\in\mathcal{D}\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star}\big{)}\) and by using the density of \(\mathcal{D}\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star}\big{)}\) in \(C_{0}\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star}\big{)}\) we deduce from (2.5.14) that \(f:=\mathcal{F}^{-1}a\,|\,(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star}\) belongs to \(C_{0}^{\prime}\big{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\star}\big{)}\).

---

Thus \(f\) is a bounded measure on \((\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\bullet}\) by the Riesz representation theorem. From Remark 2.4.4(d) we know that \(f\in C\bigl{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\bullet}\bigr{)}\) and that \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}a\) is positively homogeneous of degree \(-n\). This implies that \(f\) belongs to \(L_{1}\bigl{(}(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\bullet}\bigr{)}\) and that it is positively homogeneous of degree \(-n\). Hence, if \(f\neq 0\),

\[\infty>\int_{(\mathbb{R}^{n})^{\bullet}}|f|\,dx =\int_{0}^{\infty}r^{n-1}\int_{S^{n-1}}|f(r\omega)|\,d\omega\,dr\] \[=\int_{0}^{\infty}r^{-1}\,dr\int_{S^{n-1}}|f(\omega)|\,d\omega= \infty\ ,\]

which is impossible. Thus \(f=0\) so that \(\operatorname{supp}(\mathcal{F}^{-1}a)\subset\{0\}\). Now we deduce from Example 1.8.7(d) that

\[\mathcal{F}^{-1}a=\sum_{|\alpha|\leq k}a_{\alpha}\partial^{\alpha}\delta\]

for suitable \(k\in\mathbb{N}\) and \(a_{\alpha}\in\mathbb{C}\). Hence we infer from (2.3.3) that \(a\) is a polynomial. Since it has to be homogeneous of degree \(0\), we see that \(a=\operatorname{const}\). Lastly, it is well-known that \(a\) is a Fourier multiplier for \(L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) iff it is one for \(L_{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) (e.g., [10, IV, SS 3.1]). This covers the case \(\mathfrak{F}=L_{1}\).

The above proof follows the arguments in [10, Lemma 1.10]. Note that a similar result fails to be true for \(L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\)-multipliers if \(1<p<\infty\), as Mikhlin's theorem shows.

## 3 The Heat Equation and Related Problems

The theory of linear and nonlinear parabolic evolution equations is built on the concept of strongly continuous analytic semigroups. So far we have not seen any concrete semigroup of this type but remained exclusively within an abstract framework. Now we turn to a first concrete situation: we study in detail the heat semigroup.

But first, in Subsection 3.1, we give a simple application of the theory of convolutions of Banach-space-valued distributions to linear evolution equations. This subsection is included mostly for curiosity since it throws new light on the possible concepts of generalized solutions to abstract evolution equations.

In Subsection 3.2 we investigate the fundamental Gauss-Weierstrass or heat semigroup and identify its generator on the 'standard' function spaces. Since this semigroup is generated by the Laplace operator, it is the prototype of an 'elliptic convolution semigroup'. This class of semigroups is at the basis of the general theory of elliptic and parabolic systems of differential and pseudodifferential operators. The information that we obtain from the study of the Gauss-Weierstrass semigroup is deepened in Subsection 3.3. There we derive additional properties of its generator.

### Distributional Solutions of Evolution Equations

As a first application of the general theory of vector-valued distributions we give a short discussion of linear evolution equations in the framework of distribution theory. For this we assume that

\[A\in\mathcal{C}(E)\ .\]

Then, given \(f\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\), we consider the **linear evolution equation**

\[(\partial+A)u=f\qquad\text{in }\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\ .\] (3.1.1)

By a **distributional solution** of (3.1.1) we mean an element \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}\big{(}D(A)\big{)}\) satisfying \(\partial u+Au=f\) in \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\). To be more precise, recall from Example 1.3.1(d) that

\[\mathcal{L}\big{(}D(A),E\big{)}\times D(A)\to E\ ,\quad(B,a)\mapsto Ba\] (3.1.2)

is a multiplication. Moreover, letting \(i:\ D(A)\hookrightarrow E\), it follows that \(i\) and \(A\) belong to \(\mathcal{L}\big{(}D(A),E\big{)}\). Hence we obtain from Remark 1.6.5(c) and (d) that, recalling Remark 1.6.5(g),

\[i,A\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(D(A)),\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+ }(E)\big{)}\] (3.1.3)

and that \(\partial\circ i=i\circ\partial\). Thus, employing the natural identification \(\partial:=i\circ\partial\), we see that

\[\partial+A\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(D(A)),\mathcal{D}^{ \prime}_{+}(E)\big{)}\ .\]

This shows that the above definition of a distributional solution is meaningful.

---

#### Fundamental Solutions

Denoting the convolution with respect to multiplication (3.1.2) simply by \(\ast\) , it follows from Remark 1.9.6(i) that

\[(\partial+A)u=(\partial\delta\otimes i+\delta\otimes A)\ast u\ ,\qquad u\in \mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}\big{(}D(A)\big{)}\ .\] (3.1.4)

From this representation we easily deduce the following solvability criterion for equation (3.1.1).

#### 3.1.1 Theorem

_Suppose that there exists_

\[G\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}\big{(}\mathcal{L}(E)\big{)}\cap\mathcal{D}^{ \prime}_{+}\big{(}\mathcal{L}(E,D(A))\big{)}\ ,\] (3.1.5)

\(a\) **fundamental solution** _for \(\partial+A\), satisfying_

\[(\partial\delta\otimes i+\delta\otimes A)\ast G=\delta\otimes 1_{E}\] (3.1.6)

_and_

\[G\ast(\partial\delta\otimes i+\delta\otimes A)=\delta\otimes i\ .\] (3.1.7)

_Then equation (3.1.1) possesses for each \(f\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\) a unique distributional solution \(u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}\big{(}D(A)\big{)}\). It is given by \(u:=G\ast f\)._

ProofPut \(E_{0}:=\mathcal{L}(E)\), \(E_{1}:=\mathcal{L}\big{(}D(A),E\big{)}\), \(E_{2}:=\mathcal{L}\big{(}E,D(A)\big{)}\), \(E_{3}:=E_{5}:=E\), and \(E_{4}:=D(A)\). Then the associativity assumption of Remark 1.6.5(e) is satisfied with respect to the obvious multiplications. Hence the associativity of the associated convolution products, guaranteed by Remark 1.9.6(c), implies

\[(\partial+A)(G\ast f)=(\partial\delta\otimes i+\delta\otimes A)\ast G\ast f=( \delta\otimes 1_{E})\ast f=f\]

in \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\), thanks to (3.1.5), (3.1.6), and Remark 1.9.6(i). Thus \(G\ast f\) is a distributional solution of (3.1.1).

Conversely, let \(E_{0}:=E_{2}:=\mathcal{L}\big{(}D(A),E\big{)}\), \(E_{1}:=\mathcal{L}(E)\), \(E_{3}:=D(A)\), and \(E_{4}:=E_{5}:=E\). Then the hypotheses of Remark 1.6.5(e) are again satisfied with respect to the obvious multiplications. Hence we deduce once more from (3.1.5) and Remark 1.9.6(c) that, given a distributional solution \(u\) of (3.1.1),

\[G\ast f=G\ast(\partial+A)u=G\ast(\partial\delta\otimes i+\delta\otimes A)\ast u =(\delta\otimes i)\ast u=u\ ,\]

thanks to (3.1.7) and Remark 1.9.6(i). This gives uniqueness.

#### 3.1.2 Remark

Given the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1.1, it follows from Theorem 1.9.7 that

\[(f\mapsto u:=G\ast f)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E), \mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(D(A))\big{)}\ ,\]

that is, the unique solution \(u\) of (3.1.1) depends continuously on \(f\) (in the topology of \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}\)). This is often expressed by saying that problem (3.1.1) is **well-posed** (in the sense of Hadamard).

---

#### Fundamental Solutions and Laplace Transforms

Theorem 3.1.1 guarantees that we can solve the evolution equation \((\partial+A)u=f\) in \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\) provided we can guarantee the existence of a fundamental solution for \(\partial+A\). This can be achieved by means of Laplace transforms, provided we impose the following assumption:

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{there exists $\omega\geq 0$ such that $[\operatorname{Re}z>\omega]\subset\rho(-A)$}\\ \mbox{and the map $[\operatorname{Re}z>\omega^{\prime}]\to\mathcal{L}(E),\ \lambda\mapsto(\lambda+A)^{-1}$}\\ \mbox{is polynomially bounded for each $\omega^{\prime}>\omega$.}\end{array}\] (3.1.8)

Since the resolvent \(\lambda\mapsto(\lambda+A)^{-1}\) is a holomorphic \(\mathcal{L}(E)\)-valued function it follows from Theorem 1.10.1 that there exists \(G\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}\big{(}\mathcal{L}(E)\big{)}\) such that \((\lambda+A)^{-1}\) is the Laplace transform of \(G\) at \(\lambda\in[\operatorname{Re}z>\omega]\). The following theorem shows that \(G\) is a fundamental solution of \(\partial+A\), and that it is the only one.

#### 3.1.3 Theorem

_Let assumption (3.1.8) be satisfied. Then there exists a unique fundamental solution \(G\) for \(\partial+A\)._

Proof.: Suppose that there exists a fundamental solution \(G\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}\big{(}\mathcal{L}(E,D(A))\big{)}\) which is Laplace transformable. Then we obtain from (3.1.6) and (3.1.7), thanks to Example 1.10.10, Theorem 1.10.11, and Remark 1.10.16(b),

\[(\lambda i+A)\widetilde{G}(\lambda)=1_{E}\ ,\quad\widetilde{G}(\lambda)( \lambda i+A)=i\ ,\quad\operatorname{Re}\lambda>\omega_{0}(G)\ .\] (3.1.9)

Hence \(\widetilde{G}(\lambda)=(\lambda+A)^{-1}\) for \(\operatorname{Re}\lambda>\omega\vee\omega_{0}(G)\). Thus the identity theorem for holomorphic functions implies that \(\omega_{0}(G)\leq\omega\), and the uniqueness of \(G\) is a consequence of Remark 1.10.16.

By the observations preceding this theorem we know that there exists a unique \(G\in\mathcal{L}\mathrm{ap}_{+}\big{(}\mathcal{L}(E)\big{)}\) with \(\widetilde{G}(\lambda)=(\lambda+A)^{-1}\) for \(\operatorname{Re}\lambda>\omega\). Therefore \(\widetilde{G}(\lambda)\) belongs to \(\mathcal{L}\big{(}E,D(A)\big{)}\) so that \(G\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}\big{(}\mathcal{L}(E,D(A))\big{)}\). Hence \(\widetilde{G}\) satisfies (3.1.9) for \(\operatorname{Re}\lambda>\omega\) and the convolution theorem implies that (3.1.6) and (3.1.7) are valid. 

#### 3.1.4 Remark

Given \(A\in\mathcal{C}(E)\), one can ask for necessary and sufficient conditions for \(\partial+A\) to be an isomorphism from \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}\big{(}D(A)\big{)}\) onto \(\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\). This problem has been solved by J.L. Lions by means of the theory of _distribution semigroups_ in [19]. In that paper it is also shown that condition (3.1.8) is necessary and sufficient for a distribution semigroup to be Laplace transformable. 

#### Fundamental Solutions and Semigroups

Lastly, we consider the particularly important case that \(-A\) is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup. In this case it can be expected that the fundamental solution is related to the semigroup. The next theorem shows that this, indeed, is the case.

---

**3.1.5 Theorem**: _Suppose that \(A\in{\cal G}(E)\). Then there exists a fundamental solution for \(\partial+A\). It is given by the regular distribution \(e_{A}\), where_

\[e_{A}(t):=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}e^{-tA}\ ,&\quad t\geq 0\ ,\\ 0\ ,&\quad t<0\ .\end{array}\right.\]

_Thus problem (3.1.1) is well-posed._

ProofThe Hille-Yosida theorem implies, in particular, that \([\mathop{\rm Re}\nolimits z>\omega]\subset\rho(-A)\) for some \(\omega\in{\mathbb{R}}\) and that

\[\|(\lambda+A)^{-1}\|_{{\cal L}(E)}\leq M(\mathop{\rm Re}\nolimits\lambda-\omega )^{-1}\ ,\qquad\mathop{\rm Re}\nolimits\lambda>\omega\ ,\]

for some \(M\geq 1\). Hence condition (3.1.8) is trivially satisfied. Therefore Theorem 3.1.3 guarantees the existence of a unique fundamental solution \(G\) for \(\partial+A\), and the proof of that theorem shows that \((\lambda+A)^{-1}=\widetilde{G}(\lambda)\) for \(\mathop{\rm Re}\nolimits\lambda>\omega\). Now we infer from Example 1.10.14(a) and the uniqueness assertion of Remark 1.10.16(a) that \(G=e_{A}\).

Given \((x,g)\in E\times L_{1,{\rm loc}}({\mathbb{R}}^{+},E)\), denote by \(g^{\star}\in L_{1,{\rm loc}}({\mathbb{R}},E)\) the trivial extension of \(g\) over \({\mathbb{R}}\) and put \(f:=\delta\otimes x+g^{\star}\). Then \(g^{\star}\in{\cal D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\), and it follows from Remarks 1.9.6(i) and 1.9.8(c) that \(e_{A}\ast f\) is the regular distribution given by

\[e_{A}\ast f(t)=e^{-tA}x+\int_{0}^{t}e^{-(t-\tau)A}g(\tau)\,d\tau\ ,\qquad t \geq 0\ .\]

Thus the following result is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.1.5.

**3.1.6 Corollary**: _Suppose that \(A\in{\cal G}(E)\) and \((x,g)\in E\times L_{1,{\rm loc}}({\mathbb{R}}^{+},E)\). Then the differential equation_

\[(\partial+A)u=\delta\otimes x+g^{\star}\qquad\hbox{in }{\cal D}^{\prime}_{+}(E)\]

_is well-posed and its solution \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}_{+}\bigl{(}D(A)\bigr{)}\) is the mild solution of the linear Cauchy problem_

\[\dot{u}+Au=g(t)\ ,\quad t>0\ ,\qquad u(0)=x\ .\]

It should be remarked that Laplace transform techniques can also be applied to evolution equations of the form \(\partial^{k}u+Au=f\) for \(k\geq 2\), that is, to higher order equations (e.g., [DL90, Chapter XVI]).

### The Gauss-Weierstrass Semigroup

In this subsection we give a detailed investigation of the Gauss-Weierstrass semigroup on various spaces of functions and distributions. This semigroup is perhaps

---

the best-known semigroup (of convolutions) and has numerous applications in mathematics. It has the advantage of possessing an explicit analytic representation (through the heat kernel). Moreover, its generator is the Laplace operator, perhaps the most-studied elliptic differential operator. The results on the heat semigroup and its generator that we derive in this subsection are fundamental for the study of Bessel potential and Besov spaces.

#### The Heat Kernel

We define the **Gauss-Weierstrass** (or **heat**) **kernel**\(\{\,w_{t}\ ;\ t>0\,\}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) by

\[w_{t}(x):=(4\pi t)^{-n/2}e^{-\frac{|x|^{2}}{4t}}\ ,\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ , \quad t>0\ .\] (3.2.1)

Observe that \(w_{t}\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and \(w_{t}(x)>0\) for \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and \(t>0\).

#### 3.2.1 Lemma

\(w_{t}\in L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) _and \(\int w_{t}\,dx=1\). Moreover, \(w_{t}=\mathcal{F}^{-1}e^{-t\,|\cdot|^{2}}\) for \(t>0\)._

ProofThe first part of the assertion has already been obtained in the proof of Lemma 1.3.7.

Thanks to \(e^{-t|\cdot|^{2}}=\sigma_{\sqrt{t}}^{-1}e^{-|\cdot|^{2}}\) we obtain from (2.3.2) and (2.3.10) that

\[\mathcal{F}^{-1}e^{-t|\cdot|^{2}}=t^{-n/2}\sigma_{\sqrt{t}}\mathcal{F}^{-1}e^{ -|\cdot|^{2}}=(2\pi)^{-n}t^{-n/2}\sigma_{\sqrt{t}}\mathcal{F}e^{-|\cdot|^{2}}\ ,\] (3.2.2)

since \(e^{-|\cdot|^{2}}\) is even.

Put \(f_{n}:=e^{-|\cdot|^{2}}\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and note that \(f_{n}=f_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes f_{1}\) with \(n\) factors. Hence, by Fubini's theorem, \(\widehat{f}_{n}=\widehat{f}_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\widehat{f}_{1}\), and also \(\partial f_{1}=-2x_{1}f_{1}\). Thus (2.3.3) and (2.3.5) imply \(i\xi_{1}\widehat{f}_{1}=\overline{\partial f_{1}}=-2x_{1}\widehat{f}_{1}=-2i \,\partial\widehat{f}_{1}\). Hence \(\widehat{f}_{1}\) solves the initial value problem

\[\dot{\psi}=-(t/2)\psi\ ,\quad\psi(0)=\widehat{f}_{1}(0)=\int f_{1}\,dx=\sqrt{ \pi}\ .\]

Consequently, \(\widehat{f}_{1}(t)=\sqrt{\pi}e^{-t^{2}/4}\) for \(t\in\mathbb{R}\), so that \(\widehat{f}_{n}=\pi^{n/2}e^{-|\cdot|^{2}/4}\). Now the last assertion follows from (3.2.2).

#### The Heat Semigroup

Let \(E:=(E,|\cdot|)\) be a Banach space. We put \(w_{0}:=\delta\), where \(\delta\) is the Dirac distribution, and

\[W(t)u:=w_{t}*u\ ,\qquad u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\qquad t \geq 0\ .\]

Note that \(W(0)u=u\). Then \(\big{\{}\,W(t)\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\big{\}}\) is said to be the **Gauss-Weierstrass** (or **heat**) **semigroup**. The following theorem justifies this name. As usual, we

---

denote by

\[\Delta:=\Delta_{n}:=\partial_{1}^{2}+\cdots+\partial_{n}^{2}=-\Lambda_{0}^{2}(D)\in \mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\]

the (\(n\)-dimensional) **Laplace operator**.

A map \(U:\,\mathbb{R}^{+}\to\mathcal{L}(F)\), where \(F:=(F,\mathcal{P})\) is a LCS, is **locally uniformly bounded** if for each \(p\in\mathcal{P}\) and \(T>0\) there exist \(q\in\mathcal{P}\) and \(c>0\) such that

\[p\big{(}U(t)f\big{)}\leq cq(f)\ ,\qquad f\in F\ ,\quad t\in[0,T]\ .\]

**3.2.2 Theorem**: (i) _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\}\). Then the Gauss-Weierstrass semigroup is a locally uniformly bounded semigroup on \(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) with infinitesimal generator \(\Delta\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\), and_

\[W(\cdot)u\in C^{\infty}\big{(}\mathbb{R}^{+},\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E) \big{)}\ ,\qquad u\in\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ .\]

(ii) _Suppose that \(\mathfrak{F}\in\{\,\mbox{BUC},C_{0},L_{p}\ ;\ 1\leq p<\infty\,\}\). Then the Gauss-Weierstrass semigroup restricts from \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) to a strongly continuous analytic contraction semigroup on the Banach space \(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), whose infinitesimal generator is the \(\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\)-realization \(\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}}\) of \(\Delta\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\)._

**Proof** (i) Since \(e^{-t\,|\cdot|^{2}}\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\subset\mathcal{O}_{M}( \mathbb{R}^{n})\) for \(t>0\) and since \(1\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), it follows from (1.9.31) and Lemma 3.2.1 that

\[W(t)=w_{t}\ast\ =\mathcal{F}^{-1}e^{-t\,|\cdot|^{2}}\mathcal{F}\in\mathcal{L} \big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad t\geq 0\ .\] (3.2.3)

Note that \(\{\,e^{-t|\xi|^{2}}\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\}\) is for each \(\xi\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) a subsemigroup of the multiplicative group \((\hat{\mathbb{R}}^{+},\cdot)\). Hence \(\{\,W(t)\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\}\) is a semigroup on \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

Let

\[a_{j}(t):=\partial_{t}^{j}e^{-t|\cdot|^{2}}=(-1)^{j}\,|\cdot|^{2j}\,e^{-t| \cdot|^{2}}\ ,\qquad j\in\mathbb{N}\ ,\quad t\geq 0\ .\]

Then, by Taylor's theorem,

\[a_{j}(t+h)-a_{j}(t)-a_{j+1}(t)h=h^{2}b_{j}(t,h)\] (3.2.4)

point-wise with respect to \(\xi\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\), where

\[b_{j}(t,h):=\int_{0}^{1}(1-s)a_{j+2}(t+sh)\,ds\]

for \(t\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\) and \(h\in\hat{\mathbb{R}}\) with \(t+h\geq 0\). Observe that

\[|\partial_{\xi}^{\alpha}a_{j}(t)(\xi)|\leq c(m,T)(1+|\xi|^{2})^{j+m}\] (3.2.5)

---

for \(\xi\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\), \(0\leq t\leq T<\infty\), and \(|\alpha|\leq m\). Hence we infer from (3.2.4) that, given \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(j,k,m\in\mathbb{N}\),

\[q_{k,m}\Big{(}h^{-1}\big{[}a_{j}(t+h)-a_{j}(t)-a_{j+1}(t)h\big{]}\varphi\Big{)} \leq|h|\,c(m,T)q_{\ell,m}(\varphi)\]

for \(t\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\) and \(h\in\overset{\ast}{\mathbb{R}}\) with \(t+h\geq 0\), where \(\ell:=j+2+k+m\). This shows that for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), \(t\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\), and \(j\in\mathbb{N}\),

\[h^{-1}\big{[}a_{j}(t+h)-a_{j}(t)\big{]}\varphi\to a_{j+1}(t)\varphi\qquad\text {in }\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\] (3.2.6)

as \(h\to 0\). Thanks to \(a_{j}(t)\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\),

\[a_{j}(t)(D)=\mathcal{F}^{-1}a_{j}(t)\mathcal{F}\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S }(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad t\geq 0\ ,\quad j\in\mathbb{N}\ .\]

Consequently, (3.2.6) and (2.3.1) imply that

\[\begin{split}\frac{a_{j}(t+h)(D)\varphi-a_{j}(t)(D)\varphi}{h}& =\mathcal{F}^{-1}\Big{(}\frac{a_{j}(t+h)-a_{j}(t)}{h}\widehat{ \varphi}\Big{)}\\ &\to a_{j+1}(t)(D)\varphi\end{split}\] (3.2.7)

in \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) as \(h\to 0\) for each \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), \(t\geq 0\), and \(j\in\mathbb{N}\), and it follows that

\[a_{j}(t)(D)=(-1)^{j}(-\Delta)^{j}W(t)=\Delta^{j}W(t)\ ,\qquad t\geq 0\ ,\quad j \in\mathbb{N}\ .\] (3.2.8)

From (3.2.7) and (3.2.8) we deduce that

\[W(\cdot)\varphi\in C^{\infty}\big{(}\mathbb{R}^{+},\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n} ,E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\]

and that

\[\partial_{t}^{j}W(t)\varphi=\Delta^{j}W(t)\varphi\ ,\qquad t>0\ ,\quad j\in \mathbb{N}\ ,\quad\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ .\] (3.2.9)

Given \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(k,m\in\mathbb{N}\), (3.2.5) entails

\[q_{k,m}\big{(}a_{0}(t)\varphi\big{)}\leq c(m,T)q_{k+m,m}(\varphi)\ ,\qquad 0\leq t \leq T<\infty\ .\]

Thanks to \(W(t)\varphi=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\big{(}a_{0}(t)\widehat{\varphi}\big{)}\), this implies, together with (2.3.1), that the Gauss-Weierstrass semigroup is locally uniformly bounded on \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\).

Since \(a_{j}(t)\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), it follows from (1.9.31) that \(a_{j}(t)(D)\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\). Moreover,

\[a_{j}(t)(D)u(\varphi)=\mathcal{F}^{-1}a_{j}(t)\mathcal{F}u(\varphi)=u\big{(} \mathcal{F}a_{j}(t)\mathcal{F}^{-1}\varphi\big{)}\] (3.2.10)

for \(u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\). It is obvious that the estimates leading to (3.2.7) also imply that, given \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\),

\[\mathcal{F}\Big{(}\frac{a_{j}(t+h)-a_{j}(t)}{h}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\varphi\Big{)} \to\mathcal{F}a_{j+1}(t)\mathcal{F}^{-1}\varphi\]

---

as \(h\to 0\) in \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\). Hence it follows from (3.2.10) that

\[\frac{a_{j}(t+h)(D)u-a_{j}(t)(D)u}{h}(\varphi)\to a_{j+1}(D)u(\varphi)\qquad\text {as }h\to 0\] (3.2.11)

for \(u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\). Since \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) is a Montel space, the Banach-Steinhaus theorem guarantees that the convergence in (3.2.11) holds uniformly for \(\varphi\) in bounded subsets of \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\), that is,

\[h^{-1}\big{[}a_{j}(t+h)(D)u-a_{j}(t)(D)u\big{]}\to a_{j+1}(t)(D)u\qquad\text{ in }\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n}),E\big{)}=\mathcal{S}^{\prime}( \mathbb{R}^{n},E)\]

as \(h\to 0\). This shows that

\[W(\cdot)u\in C^{\infty}\big{(}\mathbb{R}^{+},\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^ {n},E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad u\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\ ,\]

and that (3.2.9) is true for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). A similar argument guarantees that the map \(t\mapsto W(t)\) from \(\mathbb{R}^{+}\) to \(\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\) is locally uniformly bounded. Since \(\big{\{}\,W(t)\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\big{\}}\) is a semigroup on \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) as well, assertion (i) has been completely proven.

(ii) It follows from Lemma 3.2.1 and Theorem 1.9.9 that \(W(t)\in\mathcal{L}(\mathfrak{F})\) with \(\|W(t)\|\leq 1\), where \(\mathfrak{F}:=\mathfrak{F}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\). Hence we deduce from (i) that \(\big{\{}\,W(t)\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\big{\}}\) restricts to a contraction semigroup on \(\mathfrak{F}\). Next observe that

\[w_{\varepsilon}(x)=\big{(}\sqrt{\varepsilon}\big{)}^{-n}w_{1}\big{(}x\big{/} \sqrt{\varepsilon}\big{)}\ ,\qquad\varepsilon>0\ ,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ .\]

Since \(w_{1}\in L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and \(\int w_{1}\,dx=1\) by Lemma 3.2.1, we see that \(\{\,w_{\varepsilon^{2}}\ ;\ \varepsilon>0\,\}\) is an approximate identity. Hence [1, (III.4.2.23)-(III.4.2.25)] and the closedness of \(C_{0}\) in \(BUC\) imply that \(W(t)u\to u\) in \(\mathfrak{F}\) as \(t\to 0\) for each \(u\in\mathfrak{F}\). Thus \(\big{\{}\,W(t)\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\big{\}}\) is a strongly continuous semigroup on \(\mathfrak{F}\).

Let \(A\) be the infinitesimal generator of \(\big{\{}\,W(t)\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\big{\}}\) on \(\mathfrak{F}\). Then, given \(u\in\operatorname{dom}(A)\), it follows that

\[t^{-1}\big{(}W(t)u-u\big{)}\to Au\] (3.2.12)

in \(\mathfrak{F}\) as \(t\to 0\). Since \(\mathfrak{F}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and the left-hand side of (3.2.12) converges in \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) towards \(\Delta u\) by (i), we see that \(A\subset\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}}\).

On the other hand, given \(u\in\operatorname{dom}(\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})\), the strong continuity of \(W\) implies \(W(\cdot)\Delta u\in C(\mathbb{R}^{+},\mathfrak{F})\) and, consequently,

\[\int_{0}^{t}W(\tau)\Delta u\,d\tau\in\mathfrak{F}\ ,\qquad t>0\ .\]

---

Thus we infer from Fubini's theorem that, for \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\),

\[\int_{0}^{t}W(\tau)\Delta u\,d\tau(\varphi) =\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\!\int_{0}^{t}\!\bigl{(}W(\tau)\Delta u\bigr{)} (x)\varphi(x)\,d\tau\,dx\] \[=\int_{0}^{t}W(\tau)\Delta u(\varphi)\,d\tau=\int_{0}^{t}u\bigl{(} \Delta W(\tau)\varphi\bigr{)}\,d\tau\] \[=\int_{0}^{t}u\bigl{(}\partial_{\tau}W(\tau)\varphi\bigr{)}\,d\tau= \int_{0}^{t}\partial_{\tau}\bigl{[}u\bigl{(}W(\tau)\varphi\bigr{)}\bigr{]}\,d\tau\] \[=u\bigl{(}(W(t)-1)\varphi\bigr{)}=\bigl{(}W(t)-1\bigr{)}u(\varphi )\ ,\]

where we used the fact that

\[\mathcal{F}^{-1}e^{-t|\cdot|^{2}}\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}e^{-t|\cdot|^{2}} \mathcal{F}^{-1}\]

by the evenness of \(\xi\mapsto e^{-t|\xi|^{2}}\), and (3.2.9). Consequently,

\[\int_{0}^{t}W(\tau)\Delta u\,d\tau=W(t)u-u\]

so that

\[t^{-1}\bigl{(}W(t)u-u\bigr{)}=\frac{1}{t}\int_{0}^{t}W(\tau)\Delta u\,d\tau \to\Delta u\]

in \(\mathfrak{F}\) as \(t\to 0\). This shows that \(u\in\operatorname{dom}(A)\) so that \(A=\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}}\).

Clearly,

\[\partial_{t}w_{t}(x)=\frac{1}{t}\Bigl{(}-\frac{n}{2}+\frac{|x|^{2}}{4t}\Bigr{)} w_{t}(x)=:\dot{w}_{t}(x)\ ,\qquad t>0\ ,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\ .\]

Hence \(\|\dot{w}_{t}\|_{1}\leq c(\varepsilon)\) for \(t\geq\varepsilon>0\) and, thanks to Lebesgue's theorem,

\[(t\mapsto\dot{w}_{t})\in C\bigl{(}(0,\infty),L_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\bigr{)}\ .\]

Thus we infer from Theorem 1.9.9 and Remark 1.9.6(g) that

\[(t\mapsto w_{t}*u)\in C^{1}\bigl{(}(0,\infty),\mathfrak{F}\bigr{)}\]

with

\[\partial_{t}\bigl{(}W(t)u\bigr{)}=\partial_{t}(w_{t}*u)=\dot{w}_{t}*u\ ,\qquad u \in\mathfrak{F}\ ,\quad t>0\ .\] (3.2.13)

Consequently,

\[\operatorname{im}\bigl{(}W(t)\bigr{)}\subset\operatorname{dom}(A)\ ,\qquad t>0\ .\] (3.2.14)

Note that

\[t\dot{w}_{t}=-\frac{n}{2}w_{t}+v_{t}\qquad\text{with}\quad v_{t}(x):=\frac{|x| ^{2}}{4t}w_{t}(x)\ .\] (3.2.15)

Since

\[v_{t}=\bigl{(}\sqrt{4t}\bigr{)}^{-n}\sigma_{\sqrt{4t}}h\qquad\text{with}\quad h (x):=\pi^{-n/2}\,|x|^{2}\,e^{-|x|^{2}}\ ,\]

---

we see from (2.3.12) that

\[\eqalign{\|v_{t}\|_{1}=\|h\|_{1}&=\pi^{-n/2}\,{\rm vol}(S^{n-1})\int_{0}^{\infty}r^ {n+2}e^{-r^{2}}\,dr/r\cr&=2^{-1}\pi^{-n/2}\,{\rm vol}(S^{n-1})\Gamma\Bigl{(}{n \over 2}+1\Bigr{)}=n/2\ ,\cr}\]

since \({\rm vol}(S^{n-1})=n\omega_{n}\), where

\[\omega_{n}:={\rm vol}({{R}}^{n})=\pi^{n/2}\Big{/}\Gamma\Bigl{(}{n\over 2}+1 \Bigr{)}\ .\]

Thus we obtain from Lemma 3.2.1 and (3.2.13)-(3.2.16) that

\[\bigl{\|}t\partial_{t}\bigl{(}W(t)u\bigr{)}\bigr{\|}=\|tAW(t)u\|\leq n\,\|u\| \ ,\qquad t>0\ .\]

Now Yosida's characterization of analytic semigroups (e.g., [Dav80, Theorem 2.3.9]) implies that \(\bigl{\{}\,W(t)\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\bigr{\}}\) is an analytic semigroup on \({{F}}\).

3.2.3 Remarks **(a)**: Since \(e^{-t|\cdot|^{2}}\) is an even function,

\[W(t)u(\varphi)=u\bigl{(}W(t)\varphi\bigr{)}\ ,\qquad u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({{R}} ^{n},E)\ ,\quad\varphi\in{\cal S}({{R}}^{n})\ ,\]

for \(t>0\), as noticed in the above proof.
**(b)**: In the following we often put

\[e^{t\Delta}:=W(t)\ ,\qquad t\geq 0\ .\]

Thanks to (3.2.3) this somewhat imprecise notation is consistent with the general notation \(m(D):={\cal F}^{-1}m{\cal F}\). Due to Theorem 3.2.2(ii) it is also consistent with our general notation \(\{\,e^{-tA}\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\}\) for the semigroup generated by \(-A\).
**(c)**: Suppose that \(a\in{\cal O}_{M}({{R}}^{n})\) with \(\inf{\rm Re}\,a\geq\omega>-\infty\). Then \(e^{-ta}\in{\cal O}_{M}({{R}}^{n})\) for \(t\geq 0\) and

\[e^{-ta(D)}:={\cal F}^{-1}e^{-ta}{\cal F}\ ,\qquad t\geq 0\ ,\]

is well-defined. An obvious modification of the proof of Theorem 3.2.2(i) shows that \(\{\,e^{-ta(D)}\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\}\) is a locally uniformly bounded semigroup on \({\cal S}({{R}}^{n},E)\) and on \({\cal S}^{\prime}({{R}}^{n},E)\) with infinitesimal generator \(-a(D)\). Moreover, given \(u\in{\cal S}({{R}}^{n},E)\) or \(u\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({{R}}^{n},E)\), the map \(t\mapsto e^{-ta(D)}u\) is smooth from \({{R}}^{+}\) into \({\cal S}({{R}}^{n},E)\) or \({\cal S}^{\prime}({{R}}^{n},E)\), respectively.

The above assumptions are satisfied, for example, if \(a(\xi):=i\,\langle h,\xi\rangle\) for \(\xi\in{{R}}^{n}\) and a fixed vector \(h:=(h^{1},\ldots,h^{n})\in{{R}}^{n}\), or if \(a(\xi)=z\,|\xi|^{2}\) for \(\xi\in{{R}}^{n}\) and some fixed \(z\in[{\rm Re}\,z\geq 0]\). In the first case \(a(D)=\partial_{h}\), the **directional derivative** in the direction \(h\), that is,

\[\partial_{h}:=\sum_{j=1}^{n}h^{j}\partial_{j}\ ,\]

---

and \(e^{-ta(D)}=e^{-t\partial_{h}}=\tau_{th}\), where \(\tau_{th}\) denotes right translation by the vector \(th\) (cf. [Ama95, (III.4.2.6))]. In the second case, letting in particular \(z:=i\), we obtain the **Schrodinger semigroup**.

**(d)** Let \(F:=(F,{\cal P})\) be an LCS and suppose that \(\big{\{}\,U(t)\ ;\ t\geq 0\,\big{\}}\) is a locally uniformly bounded semigroup on \(F\) such that \(U(\cdot)f\in C^{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{+},F)\) for each \(f\in F\). Then, defining \(A\) by \(Af=\partial_{t}\big{(}U(t)f\big{)}\big{|}_{t=0}\) for \(f\in F\), it follows that \(A\in{\cal L}(F)\) and that the Cauchy problem

\[\dot{u}=Au\ ,\quad t>0\ ,\qquad u(0)=f\]

has for each \(f\in F\) a unique solution \(u\in C^{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{+},F)\), namely \(u(\cdot)=U(\cdot)f\).

This follows by mimicking the corresponding proof for the case that \(F\) is a Banach space, \(-A\in{\cal G}(F)\), and \(f\in{\rm dom}(A)\).

**(e)** From Theorem 3.2.2 and (d) we infer that, given \(u^{0}\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), the Cauchy problem

\[\partial_{t}u-\Delta u=0\quad\hbox{in }\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\dot{\overline{ \mathbb{R}}}^{+}\ ,\qquad u(\cdot,0)=u^{0}\] (3.2.18)

has a unique solution \(u(\cdot,t,u^{0})\) with

\[\big{[}t\mapsto u(\cdot,t,u^{0})\big{]}\in C^{\infty}\big{(}{\mathbb{R}}^{+},{ \cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\]

and that it is given by \(u(\cdot,t,u^{0})=w_{t}*u^{0}\) for \(t>0\). Since \(\partial_{t}^{j}w_{t}\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\) for \(t>0\) and \(j\in\mathbb{N}\), Proposition 1.2.7 and Remark 1.9.6(g) show that

\[\partial_{t}^{j}u(\cdot,t,u^{0})\in{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ .\]

From this one easily derives

\[\big{[}(x,t)\mapsto u(x,t,u^{0})\big{]}\in C^{\infty}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times \dot{\overline{\mathbb{R}}}^{+},E)\] (3.2.19)

for \(u^{0}\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\). This shows that the Gauss-Weierstrass semigroup possesses a rather strong 'smoothing property'.

Recall that \({\cal E}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\hookrightarrow{\cal S}^{\prime}({ \mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\). Thus the Cauchy problem (3.2.18) has for each initial value \(u^{0}\) that is a distribution with compact support the unique solution \(u(\cdot,t,u^{0})\in{\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), and it satisfies (3.2.19). In particular, we can choose \(u^{0}=\delta\) and find that the _heat kernel is the unique temperate solution of the heat equation_

\[\partial_{t}u=\Delta u\quad\hbox{on }\mathbb{R}^{n}\ ,\qquad t>0\ ,\]

_satisfying \(u(0)=\delta\)._ In other words, \(w_{t}\) is for \(t>0\) the temperature distribution evolving according to the heat equation from a unit-strength point-source at \((x,t)=(0,0)\). The fact that \(w_{t}\) is smooth (indeed: analytic) for \(t>0\) reflects the property of **infinite speed of propagation** of the heat equation.

**(f)** The elements of \({\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) are slowly increasing distributions. More precisely, \(u\in{\cal D}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\) belongs to \({\cal S}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\) iff there exist \(k\in\mathbb{N}\), \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n}\,\), and \(f\in BC({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\)

---

such that \(u=\partial^{\alpha}(\Lambda_{1}^{k}f)\) (cf. [Sch66, Chap. VII, Theoreme VI]). Thus, given any continuous function \(u^{0}\) on \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) growing at most polynomially, the initial value problem (3.2.18) has a unique solution \(u(\cdot,u^{0})\) that is smooth and such that \(u(t,u^{0})\) grows at most polynomially in \(x\) for each \(t>0\). If we drop the requirement that \(u(t,u^{0})\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) for \(t\geq 0\), uniqueness can no longer be guaranteed. In fact, Tychonov constructed a classical solution of the heat equation vanishing for \(t=0\) and growing faster than exponentially in \(x\) (cf. [Hel60, I.4.3] or [DiB95, V.4.1]). The same construction also shows that the backward Cauchy problem

\[\partial_{t}u=\Delta u\ ,\quad t<0\ ,\qquad u(\cdot,0)=u^{0}\]

is not well-posed.

### Bessel Potentials

Since \(-\Delta\) generates the Gauss-Weierstrass semigroup on the classical function spaces we can define the fractional powers \((\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\) of \(\rho^{2}-\Delta\) by means of the general theory developed in [Ama95, Subsection III.6]. On the other hand, we can also define \((\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\) naturally by means of Fourier transforms. It is reasonable to expect that these two definitions give the same result. That this is indeed the case, at least if \(\operatorname{Re}z\neq 0\), is proven in Proposition 3.3.2. If we assume that \(E\) is a UMD space then we can show that this equality prevails for every \(z\in\mathbb{C}\). More importantly, we show in Theorem 3.3.3 that \(\rho^{2}-\Delta\) has bounded imaginary powers. Lastly, we complement these results by some classical representation theorems.

#### Bessel Kernels

Let \(E:=(E,|\cdot|)\) be a Banach space. In the following we put

\[J_{\rho}^{z}:=\Lambda_{\rho}^{z}(D)\ ,\quad J^{z}:=J_{1}^{z}\ ,\qquad z\in \mathbb{C}\ ,\quad\rho>0\ .\] (3.3.1)

Since \(\Lambda_{\rho}^{z}\in\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) by Example 2.4.7(b), it follows that

\[J_{\rho}^{z}\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\cap \mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ .\] (3.3.2)

It is also obvious that

\[J_{\rho}^{z_{1}+z_{2}}=J_{\rho}^{z_{1}}J_{\rho}^{z_{2}}\ ,\quad J_{\rho}^{0}= \operatorname{id}\ ,\qquad z_{1},z_{2}\in\mathbb{C}\ ,\quad\rho>0\ ,\] (3.3.3)

so that \(\{\,J_{\rho}^{z}\ ;\ z\in\mathbb{C}\,\}\) is a group of continuous automorphisms of \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\) and of \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), respectively.

Noting that \(\Lambda_{\rho}^{z}=\rho^{z}\sigma_{\rho}\Lambda_{1}^{z}\), it follows from (2.3.9) and (2.3.10) that

\[J_{\rho}^{z}=\rho^{z}\sigma_{\rho}^{-1}J^{z}\sigma_{\rho}\ ,\qquad z\in\mathbb{ C}\ ,\quad\rho>0\ .\] (3.3.4)

---

Observe that \(J_{\rho}^{2}=\rho^{2}-\Delta\). Hence it is natural to put

\[(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z/2}:=J_{\rho}^{z}\ ,\qquad z\in{\mathbb{C}}\ ,\quad\rho>0\ .\] (3.3.5)

Then (3.3.3) implies that \((\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{k}\) are the ordinary powers of

\[\rho^{2}-\Delta\in{\mathcal{L}}\big{(}{\mathcal{S}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)} \cap{\mathcal{L}}\big{(}{\mathcal{S}}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)}\]

for \(k\in{\mathbb{Z}}\). Thus (3.3.5) is a natural way of defining the powers of \(\rho^{2}-\Delta\) for every \(z\in{\mathbb{C}}\).

Now let

\[{\mathfrak{F}}\in\{\,BUC,C_{0},L_{p}\ ;\ 1\leq p<\infty\,\}\] (3.3.6)

and let \(\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}}\) be the \({\mathfrak{F}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\)-realization of \(\Delta\in{\mathcal{L}}\big{(}{\mathcal{S}}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)}\). Then, \(\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}}\) being the infinitesimal generator of the Gauss-Weierstrass semigroup on \({\mathfrak{F}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\), it follows that \(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}}\) is of positive type for \(\rho>0\). Hence the fractional powers \((\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}\) are well-defined by [1, Theorem III.4.6.5]. In the following we show that \((\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}\) equals the \({\mathfrak{F}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\)-realization \(\big{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\big{]}_{\mathfrak{F}}\) of

\[(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}=J_{\rho}^{2\,z}\in{\mathcal{L}}\big{(}{\mathcal{S}}^{ \prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\big{)}\]

for \(\rho>0\) and \(\operatorname{Re}z\neq 0\). This shows that (3.3.5) is also consistent with the theory of fractional powers developed in [1, Subsection III.4.6], provided \(\operatorname{Re}z\neq 0\). To prove this we need some preparation.

We define the **Bessel potentials** or **Bessel kernels**\(\{\,G_{\rho}^{z}\ ;\ \operatorname{Re}z>0\,\}\) for \(\rho>0\) by

\[G_{\rho}^{z}(x):=\frac{1}{\Gamma(z/2)}\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z/2}e^{-t\rho^{2}}w_ {t}(x)\,dt/t\ ,\qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ .\] (3.3.7)

Note that \(G_{\rho}^{z}(x)>0\) for \(z>0\).

**3.3.1 Lemma**: \(G_{\rho}^{z}={\mathcal{F}}^{-1}\Lambda_{\rho}^{-z}\in L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) _with \(\|G_{\rho}^{z}\|_{1}\leq\rho^{-\operatorname{Re}z}\,\big{|}\Gamma(\operatorname {Re}z/2)/\Gamma(z/2)\big{|}\). If \(z>0\) then \(\|G_{\rho}^{z}\|_{1}=\int G_{\rho}^{z}\,dx=\rho^{-z}\)._

**Proof** Observe that, trivially, \(\Lambda_{\rho}^{2}(\xi)\in{\mathcal{G}}({\mathbb{C}};1,-\rho^{2})\) for \((\xi,\rho)\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{\mathbb{R}}\). Thus Theorem III.4.6.6 of [1] implies

\[\Lambda_{\rho}^{-2\,z}(\xi)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(z)}\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z}e^{-t\rho ^{2}}e^{-t|\xi|^{\,2}}\,dt/t\ ,\qquad(\xi,\rho)\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\times{ \dot{\mathbb{R}}}\ ,\]

for \(\operatorname{Re}z>0\). Since \(\,\Lambda_{\rho}^{-2\,z}\in L_{\infty}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\hookrightarrow{ \mathcal{S}}^{\prime}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\,\) for \(\,\rho>0\,\) and \(\operatorname{Re}z>0\), Fubini's theorem guarantees that, given \(\varphi\in{\mathcal{S}}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\),

\[\langle\Lambda_{\rho}^{-2\,z},\varphi\rangle=\frac{1}{\Gamma(z)}\int_{0}^{ \infty}t^{z}e^{-t\rho^{2}}\big{\langle}e^{-t\,|\cdot|^{2}},\varphi\big{\rangle} \,dt/t\ .\]

---

By replacing \(\varphi\) by \({\cal F}^{-1}\varphi\) and observing Lemma 3.2.1 we infer that

\[\bigl{\langle}{\cal F}^{-1}\Lambda_{\rho}^{-2z},\varphi\bigr{\rangle} =\bigl{\langle}\Lambda_{\rho}^{-2z},{\cal F}^{-1}\varphi\bigr{\rangle}= \frac{1}{\Gamma(z)}\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z}e^{-t\rho^{2}}\bigl{\langle}e^{-t\,| \cdot|^{2}},{\cal F}^{-1}\varphi\bigr{\rangle}\,dt/t\] \[=\frac{1}{\Gamma(z)}\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z}e^{-t\rho^{2}}\langle w_ {t},\varphi\rangle\,dt/t=\langle G_{\rho}^{2z},\varphi\rangle\]

for \(\varphi\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\), where in the last step we used Fubini's theorem once more. This proves that \({\cal F}^{-1}\Lambda_{\rho}^{-2z}=G_{\rho}^{2z}\) for \(\mathop{\rm Re}z>0\) and \(\rho>0\).

Since \(w_{t}\in{\cal S}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) for \(t>0\) and \(\int w_{t}\,dx=1\) by Lemma 3.2.1, Fubini's theorem implies

\[\|G_{\rho}^{2z}\|_{1}\leq\frac{1}{\Gamma(z)}\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{\mathop{\rm Re} z}e^{-t\rho^{2}}\,dt/t=\rho^{-2\mathop{\rm Re}z}\]

for \(\mathop{\rm Re}z>0\) and \(\rho>0\), and \(\|G_{\rho}^{z}\|_{1}=\rho^{-z}\) if \(z>0\).

**Powers of \(1-\Delta\)**

**3.3.2 Proposition** _Suppose that \(\rho>0\). Then \(\bigl{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\bigr{]}_{\mathfrak{F}}\supset(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{ \mathfrak{F}})^{z}\) and \(\bigl{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\bigr{]}_{\mathfrak{F}}=(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{ \mathfrak{F}})^{z}\) for \(\mathop{\rm Re}z\neq 0\)._

**Proof** If \(\mathop{\rm Re}z>0\) then the fact that \(\Lambda_{\rho}^{-2z}\in{\cal O}_{M}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\), Lemma 3.3.1, and Remark 1.9.11(b) imply

\[J_{\rho}^{-2z}u=G_{\rho}^{2z}*u\ ,\qquad u\in\mathfrak{F}:=\mathfrak{F}({ \mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\ .\] (3.3.8)

Thus we infer from \(G_{\rho}^{2z}\in L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})\) and Theorem 1.9.9 that

\[(J_{\rho}^{-2z})_{\mathfrak{F}}=\bigl{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{-z}\bigr{]}_{ \mathfrak{F}}=J_{\rho}^{-2z}\,\bigl{|}\mathfrak{F}\in{\cal L}(\mathfrak{F})\ , \qquad\mathop{\rm Re}z>0\ .\] (3.3.9)

By means of Fubini's theorem we obtain from (3.3.7) and (3.3.8) that

\[J_{\rho}^{-2z}u=\frac{1}{\Gamma(z)}\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z}e^{-t\rho^{2}}w_{t}*u \,dt/t\ ,\qquad\mathop{\rm Re}z>0\ .\]

Thus, thanks to Theorems 3.2.2 and [Ama95, III.4.6.6],

\[J_{\rho}^{-2z}u=\frac{1}{\Gamma(z)}\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z-1}e^{-t(\rho^{2}- \Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})}u\,dt=(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{-z}u\ ,\qquad \mathop{\rm Re}z>0\ ,\] (3.3.10)

for \(u\in\mathfrak{F}\). Now it follows from (3.3.9) and (3.3.10) that the assertion is true for \(\mathop{\rm Re}z<0\).

Suppose that \(\mathop{\rm Re}z>0\) and \(u\in\mathop{\rm dom}\bigl{(}(J_{\rho}^{2z})_{\mathfrak{F}}\bigr{)}\). Then \(u\in\mathfrak{F}\) and \(v:=J_{\rho}^{2z}u\in\mathfrak{F}\). Hence

\[(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{-z}v=(J_{\rho}^{-2z})_{\mathfrak{F}}v=J_{ \rho}^{-2z}J_{\rho}^{2z}u=u\ ,\]

---

that is, \(u\in\operatorname{dom}\bigl{(}(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}\bigr{)}\) and \((\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}u=v=\bigl{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\bigr{]}_{ \mathfrak{F}}u.\) Thus

\[(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}\supset\bigl{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\bigr{]} _{\mathfrak{F}}\ ,\qquad\operatorname{Re}z>0\ .\]

Since \((\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}\) is injective and \((J_{\rho}^{2z})_{\mathfrak{F}}\) is surjective, [1, Lemma V.1.4.2] implies that the assertion is true for \(\operatorname{Re}z>0\) as well.

Lastly, suppose that \(\operatorname{Re}z=0.\) Then [1, Theorem III.4.6.5(ii)] and what has already been proven show that

\[\begin{split}(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}u& =\frac{\sin\pi z}{\pi z}\int_{0}^{\infty}s^{z}\bigl{(}s+(\rho^{2}- \Delta)_{\mathfrak{F}}\bigr{)}^{-2}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)_{\mathfrak{F}}u\,ds\\ &=\frac{\sin\pi z}{\pi z}\int_{0}^{\infty}s^{z}(s+J_{\rho}^{2})^{ -2}J_{\rho}^{2}u\,ds\end{split}\] (3.3.11)

for \(u\in\operatorname{dom}(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}}).\) Since \(\Lambda_{\rho}^{2}\) and \((s+\Lambda_{\rho}^{2})^{-2}\) belong to \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n}),\) we see that

\[(s+J_{\rho}^{2})^{-2}J_{\rho}^{2}=\mathcal{F}^{-1}(s+\Lambda_{\rho}^{2})^{-2} \Lambda_{\rho}^{2}\mathcal{F}\ .\]

Given any \(\varphi\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\) and \(\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{n},\) it is easily verified that

\[\bigl{\|}\varphi\partial^{\alpha}\bigl{[}(s+\Lambda_{\rho}^{2})^{-2})\Lambda_ {\rho}^{2}\bigr{]}\bigr{\|}_{\infty}\leq c(\alpha,\varphi,\rho)(s+\rho^{2})^{- 2}\ ,\qquad s>0\ .\]

This implies that the integral

\[\int_{0}^{\infty}s^{z}(s+\Lambda_{\rho}^{2})^{-2}\Lambda_{\rho}^{2}\,ds\] (3.3.12)

converges absolutely in \(\mathcal{O}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n}).\) Using these facts and the continuity of \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\) in \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E),\) it follows that

\[\begin{split}\int_{0}^{\infty}s^{z}(s+J_{\rho}^{2})^{-2}J_{\rho} ^{2}u\,ds&=\int_{0}^{\infty}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\bigl{(}s^{z}(s+ \Lambda_{\rho}^{2})^{-2}\Lambda_{\rho}^{2}\widehat{u}\bigr{)}\,ds\\ &=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\int_{0}^{\infty}s^{z}(s+\Lambda_{\rho}^{2})^{-2 }\Lambda_{\rho}^{2}\,ds\,\mathcal{F}u=\frac{\pi z}{\sin\pi z}\mathcal{F}^{-1} \Lambda_{\rho}^{2z}\mathcal{F}u\end{split}\]

for \(u\in\mathfrak{F}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E),\) where the last equality follows from Theorem III.4.6.5(ii) of [1] as well. Hence we obtain from (3.3.11) that

\[(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}u=\bigl{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\bigr{]}_{ \mathfrak{F}}u\ ,\qquad u\in\operatorname{dom}(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})= \operatorname{dom}(\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})\ .\] (3.3.13)

From the definition of \((\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}\) in [1, (III.4.6.21)] we know that \(\operatorname{dom}(\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})\) is a core for \((\rho^{2}-\Delta_{\mathfrak{F}})^{z}.\) Thus, since \(\bigl{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\bigr{]}_{\mathfrak{F}}\) is closed in \(\mathfrak{F},\) it follows from (3.3.13) that \(\bigl{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{z}\bigr{]}_{\mathfrak{F}}\supset(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{ \mathfrak{F}})^{z}\) for \(\operatorname{Re}z=0.\)

After these preparations we can prove the main result of this subsection.

---

**3.3.3 Theorem** _Let \(E\) be a UMD space and let \(\Delta_{p}\) be the \(L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\)-realization of \(\Delta\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}\mathcal{S}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\). Then \(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{p}\in\mathcal{BIP}\big{(}L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\) for \(1<p<\infty\) and \(\rho>0\), and_

\[\|(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{p})^{\,it}\|\leq c(n)(1+|t|^{n+1})\ ,\qquad t\in\mathbb{R}\ , \quad\rho>0\ .\]

ProofWe infer from Example 2.4.7(a) and Remark 2.4.6(a) that

\[\Lambda_{\rho}^{\,it}\in S_{\rho}^{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n}\,)\qquad\text{with}\quad \|\Lambda_{\rho}^{\,it}\|_{S_{\rho}^{0}}\leq c(n)(1+|t|^{n+1})\ ,\qquad t\in \mathbb{R}\ .\]

Hence (2.4.7) and [1, Theorem III.4.4.3] imply

\[J_{\rho}^{\,it}=\big{[}(\rho^{2}-\Delta)^{\,it}\big{]}_{L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n}, E)}\in\mathcal{L}\big{(}L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\big{)}\ ,\qquad t\in\mathbb{R}\ ,\quad\rho>0\ ,\]

with the norm bounded by \(c(n)(1+|t|^{n+1})\). Consequently, by Proposition 3.3.2,

\[\|(\rho^{2}-\Delta_{p})^{\,i}\,t\|_{p}=\|J_{\rho}^{\,it}u\|_{p}\leq c(n)(1+|t|^ {n+1})\,\|u\|_{p}\ ,\qquad\rho>0\ ,\]

for \(u\in\operatorname{dom}(\Delta_{p})\) and \(t\in\mathbb{R}\). Since \(\operatorname{dom}(\Delta_{p})\) is dense in \(L_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n},E)\), the assertion follows.

**Fourier Transforms of Radial Functions**

We close this subsection by giving another representation of the Bessel potentials, at least for \(\operatorname{Re}z>n\), explaining the name. For this we first prove a general theorem on Fourier transforms.

Recall that the Bessel function \(J_{\nu}\) (of the first kind) of index \(\nu\in\mathbb{C}\backslash(-\lx@overaccentset{{\bullet}}{\mathbb{ N}})\) is defined by

\[J_{\nu}(z)=\Big{(}\frac{z}{2}\Big{)}^{\nu}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n !\,\Gamma(n+\nu+1)}\Big{(}\frac{z}{2}\Big{)}^{2n}\ ,\qquad z\in\mathbb{C}\ ,\] (3.3.14)

where we use the principal value of the power \(z^{\nu}\). If \(\operatorname{Re}\nu>-1/2\), the integral representation

\[J_{\nu}(z)=\frac{(\frac{z}{2})^{\nu}}{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(\nu+\frac{1}{2})}\int_ {0}^{\pi}(\sin\vartheta)^{2\nu}e^{-i\,z\cos\vartheta}\,d\vartheta\ ,\qquad z \in\mathbb{C}\ ,\] (3.3.15)

is valid, and from (3.3.14) it follows easily that

\[J_{-1/2}(z)=\frac{\sqrt{2}\cos z}{\sqrt{\pi z}}\ ,\qquad z\in\mathbb{C}\ ,\] (3.3.16)

(cf. [20, Section 3.3] or [19, Chap. IX]).

---

Now we compute the Fourier transform of a radial function. That is, we assume that

\[f(x)=F(|x|)\ ,\qquad x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ ,\]

for some \(F:\ {\mathbb{R}}^{+}\to E\). Fubini's theorem implies that

\[f\in L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad F\in L_{1}({ \mathbb{R}}^{+},r^{n-1}\,dr;E)\ .\] (3.3.17)

First suppose that \(n=1\). Then, by Euler's formula for the exponential function and since \(\sin\) is odd,

\[\widehat{f}(\xi)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-i\,\xi x}F(|x|)\,dx=2\int_{0}^{ \infty}\cos(|\xi|\,r)F(r)\,dr\ ,\qquad\xi\in{\mathbb{R}}\ .\] (3.3.18)

If \(n\geq 2\),

\[\widehat{f}(\xi)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{|x|=r}F(r)e^{-i\,\langle\xi,x\rangle} \,d\sigma(x)\,dr\ ,\qquad\xi\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ ,\] (3.3.19)

where \(d\sigma\) is the volume measure of \(rS^{n-1}\). If \(\xi\neq 0\), we introduce polar coordinates in the inner integral such that \(\xi/|\xi|\) is the north pole and \(\vartheta\) is the angle between \(x\) and \(\xi\). Then

\[\int_{|x|=r}e^{-i\,\langle\xi,x\rangle}\,d\sigma(x)=r\int_{0}^{\pi}e^{-i\,|\xi| r\cos\vartheta}\,\mathrm{vol}(r\sin\vartheta S^{n-2})\,d\vartheta\ .\]

Since

\[\mathrm{vol}(r\sin\vartheta S^{n-2}) =r^{n-2}(\sin\vartheta)^{n-2}(n-1)\omega_{n-1}\] \[=2r^{n-2}(\sin\vartheta)^{n-2}\pi^{(n-1)/2}\Big{/}\Gamma\Big{(} \frac{n-1}{2}\Big{)}\ ,\]

thanks to (3.2.17), and since

\[\Gamma\Big{(}\frac{n+1}{2}\Big{)}=\frac{n-1}{2}\Gamma\Big{(}\frac{n-1}{2} \Big{)}\ ,\]

it follows that

\[\int_{|x|=r}e^{-i\,\langle\xi,x\rangle}\,d\sigma(x)=\frac{2r^{n-1}\pi^{(n-1)/2 }}{\Gamma(\frac{n-1}{2})}\int_{0}^{\pi}(\sin\vartheta)^{n-2}e^{-i\,|\xi|\,r \cos\vartheta}\,d\vartheta\ .\] (3.3.20)

Now the next theorem is almost obvious.

3.3.4 Theorem: _Suppose that \(f\in L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n},E)\) with \(f(x)=F(|x|)\) for \(x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\). Then_

\[\widehat{f}(\xi)=\frac{(2\pi)^{n/2}}{|\xi|^{(n-2)/2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}F(r)r^{n /2}\,J_{(n-2)/2}(|\xi|\,r)\,dr\ ,\qquad\xi\in{\mathbb{R}}^{n}\ .\]

---

**Proof** This follows from (3.3.15)-(3.3.20).

**3.3.5 Corollary** _Suppose that \(\rho>0\) and \({\rm Re}\,z>n\). Then_

\[G_{\rho}^{z}(x)=(2\pi)^{-n/2}\,|x|^{(2-n)/2}\int_{0}^{\infty}(\rho^{2}+r^{2})^{- z/2}r^{n/2}J_{(n-2)/2}(|x|\,r)\,dr\enspace.\]

**Proof** Since \(\Lambda_{\rho}^{-z}\in L_{1}({\mathbb{R}}^{n}\,)\) for \({\rm Re}\,z>n\), the assertion follows from Lemma 3.3.1, Theorem 3.3.4, and (2.3.2).
